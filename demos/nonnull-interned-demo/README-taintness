Notes for the taintness demo

1. personalblog-demo

Open personalblog-demo/src/net/eyde/personalblog/service/PersonalBlogService.java

* Note that 
1. PersonalBlogService.executeQuery() only accepts untainted queries,
2. PersonalBlogService.constructQuery is used to construct an untainted query.

* Run the nullness checker, by invoking the ant script

  The checker issues a warning for .getPostsByCategory():
  (possibly) tainted string category is used in the query construction.
  Solution: add @Untainted to category parameter declaration.
  This forces clients to pass an @Untainted value, which was the intention
  of the designer of the getPostsByCategory method.

* Run the checker again.  There is an error in ReadAction.executeSub(),
  which is a client of getPostsByCategory:
  reqCategory is accepted from the user (from request object) without
    validation.
  solution: apply the following diff to line 48
-    String reqCategory = cleanNull(request.getParameter("cat"));
+    String reqCategory = validate(cleanNull(request.getParameter("cat")));
  
* Run the checker one more time.  There are no errors.
