Things to suppress:

 x[] = y[] => x \subset y, x \subseq y         Done
 (x = y is handled by equality)
 x[] = y[] => x[a] \in y
 x \subset y /\ b \in x => b \in y             hard to do because how do we find x?


Things not to suppress:

Equality - this should be handled specially.

SUPPRESSION NOTES

Typically, Daikon can report many true invariants over a dtrace file.  Some
of these invariants are implied by other true invariants.  Examples include
(a and b are arrays; i and j are integers):

  a>=0 && b==a[0..i]  ==>  b subseq a
  b subseq a  ==>  b[j] in a                   Done
  b subseq a  ==>  max(b) in a                 Done
  0<=i<=j  ==>  b[i] in b[0..j]                Done
  j>=0  ==>  B[0] in B[0..J]                   Is this interesting?
  j<=b.length  ==>  B[-1] in B[J..]
  0<=i<=j  ==>  min(B[0..I]) in B[0..J]
  0<=i<=j  ==>  A[0..i] subseq A[0..j]
  0<=i<a.len  => a[i] in a                     Never instantiated

Given that the invariants on the left-hand side of the implication are
true, it is more efficient not to check the invariants on the right-hand
side.  Furthermore, it is better for users not to report the implied
invariants.  The suppression mechanism provides a set of rules for
expressing implications such as those above, and for avoiding checking or
reporting the implied (suppressed) invariants.  


Terminology:

Suppression rule:  A suppression rule expresses, in the form of a template,
which invariants imply which other invariants; examples include those at
the beginning of this document.  A particular invariant type (such as "i in
a") may have many rules that could suppress it.  To determine whether a
concrete invariant is suppressed, apply each rule for that invariant type
in turn; stop when one of them is satisfied and create a suppression
object.  (This might require the ordering of suppression rules to be
carefully chosen, for efficiency.)

Suppression object:  A suppression object is a concrete instantiation of a
suppression rule.  It is essentially a pair:
 * suppressed (or suppressee) invariant
 * list of suppressor invariants.  (In the 9 examples above, in 4 cases
   there is a single suppressor invariant, and 5 cases there are multiple
   suppressors, no one of which alone suppresses the suppressee.)

(Each invariant also points back at the suppression objects that refer to
it.  The invariant class gets two new fields:  a suppression object that
suppresses this invariant (or null if the invariant isn't suppressed), and
a list of suppression objects for which this invariant is a suppressor.)


Maintaining suppression objects:

An invariant is only suppressed by one active suppression object at a time.
If that suppression object is removed, then all the possible suppression
rules must be checked again; if one of them applies, then the object
remains suppressed, and otherwise it becomes unsuppressed.

The suppressor invariants must be at least as high in the partial order as
the suppressed invariant (if they were lower, they wouldn't be true at the
point where the suppressed object is).  Suppose that ppt C is a child of
ppt P:
   P [I1, I2]
   C [I3, I4]
It is possible for "I1 && I3" to suppress I4.  It is also possible for I1
alone to suppress I4, if I3 fell down from another parent P' of C.  But if
I1 suppresses I2, then I2 would never fall down unless I1 first fell down,
because suppressed invariants don't even see any samples, and the fact that
I1 is true at P means that I2 is certainly also still true at P, given that
I1 suppresses I2.

Rules for removing/updating suppression objects:  (The idea is to do this
as soon as an invariant is falsified (falls down), so that we don't have to
iterate flow.)

 * If some suppressor invariant falls down, we need not do anything unless
   the suppressor invariant is no longer true where the suppressed one is
   -- that is, the suppressor invariant falls down below the suppressed
   one.  In this case, we must re-run all suppression rules for the
   suppressed invariant to see whether it is still suppressed (by a
   different rule) or whether it becomes unsuppressed.
 * If the suppressed invariant falls down (is moved down the hierarchy),
   then we need not take any action unless some suppressor variable becomes
   hidden (goes out of scope:  the set of variables at a lower program point
   is not necessarily a superset of the variables at a higher program point).
   I don't think this can happen, however, because a suppressed invariant
   never sees any samples and so should never be moved down the hierarchy.

When an invariant changes formula, it notifies the suppression objects that
depend on it, and they can re-confirm; if any of them is eliminated, then
all suppression rules for the formerly suppressed invariant must be re-run.


Suppression rules:

 * IntComparisons.java.jpp is a good place to start writing suppression rules.
 * See comments in isObviousImplied, starting with "// isObviousImplied: ".
   Add comments along the lines of those throughout, every place that there
   is a "return true" from an isObviousImplied method or something it calls.
   Also see the factories.
 * Make "elementwise" imply "lexically".
 * Make (a subseq b && b lexically-< c) imply (a lexically-< c).
 * Make (a strict-subseq b && b lexically-<= c) imply (a lexically-< c).
 * Search for "lexically" in *.txt-daikon.goal.

Eventually, create a declarative syntax for suppression rules.
 * In the short term, write suppression rules by hand.
    * faster
    * gives a feel for a good declarative syntax
    * gives a feel for the translation from rules to Java code, or the
      interpreter for rules
 * To do the design:
    * Say what it will be used for (to verify that it is adequate to the task).
    * Write a bunch of examples.
    * Show it to Jeremy.  (Also see ~mistere/research/notes/redesign.txt.)
 * The design of the suppression rules comes perilously close to a language
   for a geneal-purpose theorem-prover.  But it won't be that flexible or
   general:  the search will be quite directed and the list of rules
   limited to Daikon's grammar.

Potential uses for theorem-prover:
 * Offline uses:
    * Verify that the suppression rules are all correct by running the
      prover over the suppression rules.
    * Feed the prover all the invariant classes and see which ones it says
      imply others; use the output as suppression rules.
 * Online use (for our own experimentation, not for use by users):
    * Run it over the final output (just once, at printing time), see which
      invariants are implied, and log those so that we can create
      suppression rules for those later.  The long-term goal is never to
      run a theorem-prover at analysis time, because it is slow and because
      users are forced to download it specially.

Shouldn't VarInfo.isCanonical() be restored somehow?

Testing:

(java -Xmx512m -classpath .:/g2/users/mernst/research/invariants/java:/g2/users/mernst/research/invariants/java/lib/log4j.jar:/g2/users/mernst/java:/g2/users/mernst/research/invariants/java:/g2/users/mernst/java/jtrek/jtrek.zip:/g2/users/mernst/java/OROMatcher-1.1:.:/g2/users/mernst/java/mochaandjasmine:/g2/users/mernst/java/JavaPrinter:/g2/users/mernst/java/bsh.jar:/g2/users/mernst/java/tmp:/g2/users/mernst/java/jdk/jre/lib/rt.jar:/g2/users/mernst/java/jdk/lib/tools.jar:/usr/local/lib/classes:/g2/jdk/jre/lib/rt.jar:/g2/jdk/lib/tools.jar:/g2/users/mernst/research/invariants/java/lib/jakarta-oro.jar:/g2/users/mernst/research/invariants/java/lib/java-getopt.jar:/g2/users/mernst/research/invariants/java/lib/junit.jar:/g2/users/mernst/research/invariants/java/lib/log4j.jar  daikon.PrintInvariants --suppress_cont --suppress_post QueueAr.inv.gz > QueueAr.txt-daikon3)

Now compare QueueAr.txt-daikon2 with QueueAr.txt-daikon3

----------------

There are essentially two parts to the implementation:
 * suppression rules: indicating what implies what.
   (In the future, this could be further split into the declarative syntax
   and the compiler/interpreter for that declarative syntax.)
 * dealing with appearance and elimination of propositions as invariants
   move up and down the hierarchy (in version 3).

I had initially planned this, but I think it may be a bad idea, because it
will add complexity without any new functionality.  Our basic mechanism
must be powerful enough to deal with lots of invariants becoming true and
false, and if we special-case certain circumstances, we simply won't get to
test those circumstances.  I tend to think we should get the thing working
without this special case first, and if performance is a problem, we can
add the special-casing after we are sure the initial thing works.
