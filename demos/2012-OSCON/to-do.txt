Task:  Improve and re-package the Checker Framework tutorial that currently
appears in checker-framework/demos/2012-OSCON/.  Turn this into a
self-study webpage with clear steps and tasks, and that is missing none of
the information that is needed to follow the tutorial.

Subject: Reflections on Checker Framework tutorial

Here are some reflections on the Checker Framework tutorial that Werner and
I gave last week at OSCON.  It was a mixed success, and that offers both
the opportunity to bask in the successes and to learn from the failures.

The tutorial filled the room, and Werner saw people stick their heads in
and then leave when they saw how crowded it was.  There were so many
questions that we spent almost an extra hour on Q&A, though that meant that
attendees didn't have time to build the type-checkers that they
brainstormed.  A lot of people complimented us on the tutorial and said
that they planned to try it out at their companies, or give a talk at their
companies about it.  As Werner pointed out, we got better ratings than
several other tutorials.  However, we also got some negative comments and
ratings.

There was no wifi, and so Werner put most of the tutorial materials on
memory sticks which we distributed by running around the room.  No one had
downloaded the materials in advance, though we had put a note on the
session description suggesting that.

We had a few glitches, but we liked the problem-solving attitude of the
attendees:  unlike at some conferences, they dove in to try to fix the
problems rather than just giving up or waiting for help.

Nonetheless, a fair number of people were afraid of the command line.  They
don't use it and they don't know their way around it.  Furthermore,
compiling on the command line seemed impossibly clunky and archaic to them.
As a result, they struggled, and they unfairly associated those struggles
with our tool.

Action item:  We should provide Eclipse .project files for use with the
examples in the tutorial.  (This is done for one of the examples, but
ironically for the example that we skipped when we rescheduled on the fly.)

I was giving part of the presentation, but I received the slides and the
schedule of the tutorial only that morning.  As a result, I wasn't able to
give comments or to double-check the examples.  Most importantly, I didn't
have time to become comfortable with the material I was going to present;
even for a talk that I have given before, that takes time.  This threw me
off a bit.

Action item:  We should prepare materials in advance, and commit them to
the repository.

Our original plan was:
 * explanation via slides
 * practice using type-checkers #1
 * practice using type-checkers #2
 * brief brainstorming
 * break
 * practice creating type-checkers
 * use the system on your own open-source project

We changed the schedule on the fly, cutting out example #2 of using
type-checkers and putting the practice creating type-checkers before the
break.  As a result, people didn't get enough experience running a
type-checker because they had tried only one tiny example.  Giving them a
more realistic experience would have empowered them to try it on their own
source code.  And, the vast majority of our users will never write a type
system, so I don't think we should over-emphasize it, because doing so
might alienate the main part of our audience.

Action item:  More practice with using type-checkers.  Don't over-emphasize
creating type-checkers.

The Checker Framework was not fully functional on Windows.  The Windows
installation worked for running any distributed type-checker, but not for
creating a new type-checker.  This was part of the tutorial (and was
rescheduled, on the fly, into the first half of the tutorial), so Windows
users got the impression that the system doesn't really work.  This was an
unfortunate and unfair impression, especially since most people won't
create a new type system.  Ironically, a recent simplification to the
installation instructions removed the workaround that would have provided
full functionality on Windows.  We have corrected a couple of problems and
Werner has already made a new release, which is great.  Luckily, the Linux
and Mac users generally didn't have problems.

Action item:  Test the instructions, and test more generally, on Windows.
Windows is the dominant operating system even at an open source convention
like OSCON.

Most attendees spent most of their time waiting around, and as a result
they were bored and they didn't get to try very many things.  The wireless
didn't work, so attendees didn't have access to the instructions -- neither
for installing the Checker Framework nor for what to do in the tutorial.
Werner reacted well by putting the software downloads on 7 USB sticks that
we distributed.  Unfortunately, the Checker Framework manual and the
tutorial instructions were not on the USB keys, so attendees didn't have
access to them.  We showed instructions on the projector, but this didn't
really work:  they were hard to read and weren't always what people needed
as the people moved at different speeds.  Furthermore, the tutorial
instructions, even had it been available, were buried at the bottom of the
webpage.

Action item:  In retrospect, we should have complained loudly to the
organizers in hopes that they would fix the wireless problem.  Other
tutorials, on the previous day, were also thrown off by lack of network
access.  Mike should have set up a wireless network using his cell phone,
but I think only 5 people can connect to it at a time.

Action item:  The instructions need to be clearer and more to the point;
attendees want clear step-by-step instructions about what to do, without
irrelevant text More complete instructions will enable people to follow the
tutorial by themselves; I think the information in it is great and we can
make good use of it in this way.  The distribution for the tutorial should
be a single zip file that contains everything attendees need (including the
instructions), rather than multiple downloads; this will ensure that every
attendee has access to the instructions.  We should have distributed the
instructions when we saw this was a problem, but we were too busy running
around helping people with installation problems to think at a higher
level.  This will also enable us to move faster and leaving some people
behind rather than going at the pace of the slowest participant.

The brainstorming of type systems was very productive, and it segued into a
long Q&A session.  Afterward, people drifted away rather than getting
started using the Checker Framework on their own (open source or
commercial) projects.  Many of the answers were already in the
documentation, but it's always easier for people to hear it in person and
ask questions.

Action item:  While one person is answering questions, the other should
browse the Checker Framework documentation on the projection screen, to
show the section that already answers that particular question.  This will
emphasize the quality of our documentation and encourage people to read the
documentation when they get home.

At the end of the tutorial, we asked people to get engaged, which was
great.  However, we didn't leave people with a specific action item of what
do do next.  Especially at an open source conference like OSCON, we could
imagine attracting new developers to our project, either as users or as
developers.

Action item:  Mention the mailing list and encourage people to sign up.
Somewhere on our webpages, list some specific to-do items that we need help
with, such as Eclipse and Maven integration.

Overall, the tutorial definitely made us some good contacts and some converts,
and it raised the profile.  We should build on those successes to make it
even better in the future.

More notes:

The way that the Checker Framework is invoked has changed since the
tutorial was given.  The manual has been updated, but the index.html file
for the tutorial may not have.

The use of arbitrary package names confused a number of people during our
tutorial.  Probably put the code that the attendees write in the unnamed
(top-level) package.  Failing that, put it only one level down, and be
consistent.  One point of confusion was putting the new type-checker in a
different package than the code being type-checked.  This distinction may
be able to be retained, but it needs to be explained and it is not essential
from a stylistic point of view, for people who are just starting out and
trying to understand much more important concepts.

The tutorial should be put in its own well-named directory (for example,
checker-framework/tutorial), and be prominently linked (with downloads)
from both early in the manual and from the main Checker Framework webpage,
http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/.
Then, some of the material in checker-framework/demos can perhaps be
eliminated or better-organized.

Here is an example of part of the solution that didn't appear on a slide:
@TypeQualifier
@Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)
@SubtypeOf(Unqualified.class)
public @interface Encrypted {}
The tutorial materials need to give all the solution parts, so people don't
get stuck, frustrated, and give up.

The personalblog-demo.zip file that is referenced from the index.html file
can be found at
http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/2012-oscon/personalblog-demo.zip
but we need a command that creates it from the proper sources.  We also
need a command that re-deploys the tutorial -- maybe we will run this
whenever we make a Checker Framework release.
