Preparation:
  \cp -f RestrictionTest.java-orig RestrictionTest.java
  javac RestrictionType.java
and copy android.jar from the Android "ADT bundle" to this directory

Android uses int constants instead of Java enums.
This has two problems:
 * documentation
 * error checking

- Documentation:
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/RestrictionEntry.html
introduces 4 constants for "type of restriction".

- Neither setType() nor getType() specifies the valid range for the parameter/return or what happens when the value is invalid.

Browse to file RestrictionEntry.html or the following network URLs:
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/RestrictionEntry.html#getType%28%29
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/RestrictionEntry.html#setType%28int%29

We can't tell what getType() returns, what is a legal input to setType(),
or what setType() does when its input is illegal.  But, if we read the
source code we will surely learn that, right?

- Show the implementation in RestrictionEntry.java
(taken from https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/content/RestrictionEntry.java):

setType/getType perform no data validation at all - they simply store
the info in a field and return it.

- The RestrictionTest.java file compiles without any warning:

javac -cp android.jar:. RestrictionTest.java

But it's incorrect.  This is hard to notice because 5 is between two legal
values of the argument.

- Show RestrictionType.java, which defines the type qualifier @RestrictionType.
It has two meta-annotations:
 * one defines the syntax -- @RestrictionType is a type annotation
 * the other defines the semantics -- @RestrictionType is a Fake Enumeration

- We can use @RestrictionType to annotate the Android SDK.
Show android.astub.  Using @RestrictionType documents both the constants
and the method signatures.

- Compile like this:

javac -processor org.checkerframework.checker.fenum.FenumChecker -Aquals=RestrictionType -Astubs=android.astub -cp android.jar:. Restriction.java

Note that we do not need to add any annotations in Restriction.java to get
useful feedback.

Correct the errors one-by-one.
