This directory contains sourec code for annotated versions of the JDK.

The jdk.jar and jdk8.jar files in this directory are built from here, then
copied to ../dist/ .  The Checker Framework always uses a jdk*.jar file
from checker/dist/, never from here.

If you make a change within this directory, see
https://github.com/typetools/annotated-libraries

Each subdirectory of this directory contains annotations for one type
system, in a complete copy of JDK 8 source files.  If you wish to create a
new directory (JDK annotations for a new type system), see
https://checkerframework.org/manual/#annotating-jdk .

For *non-JDK* libraries, you can find compiled versions in the Central Library:
  https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.checkerframework.annotatedlib%22
See section "Using annotated libraries" in the Checker Framework Manual
for information about using the compiled libraries in the Central Repository:
