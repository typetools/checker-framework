This directory contains annotated versions of the JDK.

(For non-JDK libraries, you can find annotated source code in forks in
https://github.com/typetools/ .  Compiled versions appear in the Central
Repository:
https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.checkerframework.annotatedlib%22
.  See section "Using annotated libraries" in the Checker Framework Manual
for information on using the compiled libraries in the Central Repository.)

The jdk.jar and jdk8.jar files in this directory are built from here, then
copied to ../dist/ .  The Checker Framework always uses a jdk*.jar file
from checker/dist/, never from here.
