This directory contains annotated versions of the JDK.

(Annotated versions of non-JDK libraries appear either as .jar files in
checker-framework/checker/lib or as stub files in a directory such as
checker-framework/checker/src/org/checkerframework/checker/nullness/astubs/ .)

See chapter "Annotating libraries" in the Checker Framework Manual for
information on using these classes.

Some generated .jar files are checked into the repository, because
generating them requires external dependencies (the Annotation File
Utilities) and because it prevents bugs related to different people using
different versions of the JDK.

If you need stub files for additional library classes -- in the JDK or another
library -- those can be generated using the StubGenerator tool along with some
manual annotating.  The "Annotating libraries" chapter of the manual describes
this process as well.

If you do create new stub files please share them with us via email at
checker-framework-dev@googlegroups.com.  Thanks!

We do not add annotations for single methods.  Our policy is to only add a
class when it is fully-annotated, with correct annotations for all of its
methods.  This avoids confusion that could result from some methods in a
class being correctly annotated and other methods not being annotated.  So,
it is best if you can provide a fully-annotated class (this requires
examining all the methods in the class).  Otherwise, provide what you can,
but the annotations won't be added to the Checker Framework distribution
until someone else gets a chance to examine all the other methods.

When adding a file, currently you should use the JDK 7 version of the file,
so that it can be compiled using JDK 7.
