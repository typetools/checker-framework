This directory contains annotated versions of the JDK.
They are provided for download to speed up building the Checker Framework.

(Annotated source code for non-JDK libraries appear in forks in
https://github.com/typetools/ .  Compiled versions appear in the Central
Repository:
https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.checkerframework.annotatedlib%22
.  See section "Using annotated libraries" in the Checker Framework Manual
for information on using these classes.)
