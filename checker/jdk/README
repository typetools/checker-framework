This directory contains annotated versions of the JDK.

(For non-JDK libraries, you can find annotated source code in forks in
https://github.com/typetools/ .  Compiled versions appear in the Central
Repository:
https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.checkerframework.annotatedlib%22
.  See section "Using annotated libraries" in the Checker Framework Manual
for information on using the compiled libraries in the Central Repository.)
