/**
 * A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific
 * system or application component.  Loggers are normally named,
 * using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace.  Logger names
 * can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on
 * the package name or class name of the logged component, such
 * as java.net or javax.swing.  In addition it is possible to create
 * "anonymous" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace.
 * <p>
 * Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger
 * factory methods.  These will either create a new Logger or
 * return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that
 * the Logger returned by one of the {@code getLogger} factory methods
 * may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the
 * Logger is not kept.
 * <p>
 * Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler
 * objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of
 * destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc.
 * <p>
 * Each Logger keeps track of a "parent" Logger, which is its
 * nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace.
 * <p>
 * Each Logger has a "Level" associated with it.  This reflects
 * a minimum Level that this logger cares about.  If a Logger's
 * level is set to <tt>null</tt>, then its effective level is inherited
 * from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its
 * parent, and so on up the tree.
 * <p>
 * The log level can be configured based on the properties from the
 * logging configuration file, as described in the description
 * of the LogManager class.  However it may also be dynamically changed
 * by calls on the Logger.setLevel method.  If a logger's level is
 * changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child
 * logger that has <tt>null</tt> as its level will inherit its
 * effective level from its parent.
 * <p>
 * On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap
 * check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the
 * effective log level of the logger.  If the request level is
 * lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately.
 * <p>
 * After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate
 * a LogRecord to describe the logging message.  It will then call a
 * Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the
 * record should be published.  If that passes it will then publish
 * the LogRecord to its output Handlers.  By default, loggers also
 * publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree.
 * <p>
 * Each Logger may have a ResourceBundle name associated with it.
 * The named bundle will be used for localizing logging messages.
 * If a Logger does not have its own ResourceBundle name, then
 * it will inherit the ResourceBundle name from its parent,
 * recursively up the tree.
 * <p>
 * Most of the logger output methods take a "msg" argument.  This
 * msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key.
 * During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization
 * ResourceBundle and if the ResourceBundle has a mapping for the msg
 * string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value.
 * Otherwise the original msg string is used.  Typically, formatters use
 * java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so
 * for example a format string "{0} {1}" would format two parameters
 * as strings.
 * <p>
 * A set of methods alternatively take a "msgSupplier" instead of a "msg"
 * argument.  These methods take a {@link Supplier}{@code <String>} function
 * which is invoked to construct the desired log message only when the message
 * actually is to be logged based on the effective log level thus eliminating
 * unnecessary message construction. For example, if the developer wants to
 * log system health status for diagnosis, with the String-accepting version,
 * the code would look like:
 <pre><code>

   class DiagnosisMessages {
     static String systemHealthStatus() {
       // collect system health information
       ...
     }
   }
   ...
   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages.systemHealthStatus());
</code></pre>
 * With the above code, the health status is collected unnecessarily even when
 * the log level FINER is disabled. With the Supplier-accepting version as
 * below, the status will only be collected when the log level FINER is
 * enabled.
 <pre><code>

   logger.log(Level.FINER, DiagnosisMessages::systemHealthStatus);
</code></pre>
 * <p>
 * When mapping ResourceBundle names to ResourceBundles, the Logger
 * will first try to use the Thread's ContextClassLoader.  If that
 * is null it will try the
 * {@linkplain java.lang.ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system ClassLoader} instead.
 * <p>
 * Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of
 * the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter.
 * <p>
 * Note that formatting need not occur synchronously.  It may be delayed
 * until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink.
 * <p>
 * The logging methods are grouped in five main categories:
 * <ul>
 * <li><p>
 *     There are a set of "log" methods that take a log level, a message
 *     string, and optionally some parameters to the message string.
 * <li><p>
 *     There are a set of "logp" methods (for "log precise") that are
 *     like the "log" methods, but also take an explicit source class name
 *     and method name.
 * <li><p>
 *     There are a set of "logrb" method (for "log with resource bundle")
 *     that are like the "logp" method, but also take an explicit resource
 *     bundle name for use in localizing the log message.
 * <li><p>
 *     There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the
 *     "entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and
 *     throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods).
 * <li><p>
 *     Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the
 *     very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a
 *     simple string at a given log level.  These methods are named
 *     after the standard Level names ("severe", "warning", "info", etc.)
 *     and take a single argument, a message string.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and
 * method name, the Logging framework will make a "best effort"
 * to determine which class and method called into the logging method.
 * However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred
 * information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!).
 * Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when
 * JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible
 * to reliably locate the calling class and method.
 * <P>
 * All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe.
 * <p>
 * <b>Subclassing Information:</b> Note that a LogManager class may
 * provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in
 * the namespace.  Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they
 * are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should
 * take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and
 * should delegate operations such as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)"
 * to that instance.  Note that in order to intercept all logging
 * output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method.
 * All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this
 * log(LogRecord) method.
