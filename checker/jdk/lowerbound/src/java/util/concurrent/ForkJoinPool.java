/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} for running {@link ForkJoinTask}s.
 * A {@code ForkJoinPool} provides the entry point for submissions
 * from non-{@code ForkJoinTask} clients, as well as management and
 * monitoring operations.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} differs from other kinds of {@link
 * ExecutorService} mainly by virtue of employing
 * <em>work-stealing</em>: all threads in the pool attempt to find and
 * execute subtasks created by other active tasks (eventually blocking
 * waiting for work if none exist). This enables efficient processing
 * when most tasks spawn other subtasks (as do most {@code
 * ForkJoinTask}s). When setting <em>asyncMode</em> to true in
 * constructors, {@code ForkJoinPool}s may also be appropriate for use
 * with event-style tasks that are never joined.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} is constructed with a given target
 * parallelism level; by default, equal to the number of available
 * processors. The pool attempts to maintain enough active (or
 * available) threads by dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming
 * internal worker threads, even if some tasks are stalled waiting to
 * join others. However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the
 * face of blocked IO or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested
 * {@link ManagedBlocker} interface enables extension of the kinds of
 * synchronization accommodated.
 *
 * <p>In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this
 * class provides status check methods (for example
 * {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing,
 * tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method
 * {@link #toString} returns indications of pool state in a
 * convenient form for informal monitoring.
 *
 * <p> As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three
 * main task execution methods summarized in the following
 * table. These are designed to be used by clients not already engaged
 * in fork/join computations in the current pool.  The main forms of
 * these methods accept instances of {@code ForkJoinTask}, but
 * overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain {@code
 * Runnable}- or {@code Callable}- based activities as well.  However,
 * tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally
 * <em>NOT</em> use these pool execution methods, but instead use the
 * within-computation forms listed in the table.
 *

 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Normally a single {@code ForkJoinPool} is
 * used for all parallel task execution in a program or subsystem.
 * Otherwise, use would not usually outweigh the construction and
 * bookkeeping overhead of creating a large set of threads. For
 * example, a common pool could be used for the {@code SortTasks}
 * illustrated in {@link RecursiveAction}. Because {@code
 * ForkJoinPool} uses threads in {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#isDaemon
 * daemon} mode, there is typically no need to explicitly {@link
 * #shutdown} such a pool upon program exit.

 * static final ForkJoinPool mainPool = new ForkJoinPool();

 *   mainPool.invoke(new SortTask(array, 0, array.length));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation notes</b>: This implementation restricts the
 * maximum number of running threads to 32767. Attempts to create
 * pools with greater than the maximum number result in
 * {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 *
 * <p>This implementation rejects submitted tasks (that is, by throwing
 * {@link RejectedExecutionException}) only when the pool is shut down
 * or internal resources have been exhausted.

    /*
     * Implementation Overview
     *
     * This class provides the central bookkeeping and control for a
     * set of worker threads: Submissions from non-FJ threads enter
     * into a submission queue. Workers take these tasks and typically
     * split them into subtasks that may be stolen by other workers.
     * Preference rules give first priority to processing tasks from
     * their own queues (LIFO or FIFO, depending on mode), then to
     * randomized FIFO steals of tasks in other worker queues, and
     * lastly to new submissions.
     *
     * The main throughput advantages of work-stealing stem from
     * decentralized control -- workers mostly take tasks from
     * themselves or each other. We cannot negate this in the
     * implementation of other management responsibilities. The main
     * tactic for avoiding bottlenecks is packing nearly all
     * essentially atomic control state into a single 64bit volatile
     * variable ("ctl"). This variable is read on the order of 10-100
     * times as often as it is modified (always via CAS). (There is
     * some additional control state, for example variable "shutdown"
     * for which we can cope with uncoordinated updates.)  This
     * streamlines synchronization and control at the expense of messy
     * constructions needed to repack status bits upon updates.
     * Updates tend not to contend with each other except during
     * bursts while submitted tasks begin or end.  In some cases when
     * they do contend, threads can instead do something else
     * (usually, scan for tasks) until contention subsides.
     *
     * To enable packing, we restrict maximum parallelism to (1<<15)-1
     * (which is far in excess of normal operating range) to allow
     * ids, counts, and their negations (used for thresholding) to fit
     * into 16bit fields.
     *
     * Recording Workers.  Workers are recorded in the "workers" array
     * that is created upon pool construction and expanded if (rarely)
     * necessary.  This is an array as opposed to some other data
     * structure to support index-based random steals by workers.
     * Updates to the array recording new workers and unrecording
     * terminated ones are protected from each other by a seqLock
     * (scanGuard) but the array is otherwise concurrently readable,
     * and accessed directly by workers. To simplify index-based
     * operations, the array size is always a power of two, and all
     * readers must tolerate null slots. To avoid flailing during
     * start-up, the array is presized to hold twice #parallelism
     * workers (which is unlikely to need further resizing during
     * execution). But to avoid dealing with so many null slots,
     * variable scanGuard includes a mask for the nearest power of two
     * that contains all current workers.  All worker thread creation
     * is on-demand, triggered by task submissions, replacement of
     * terminated workers, and/or compensation for blocked
     * workers. However, all other support code is set up to work with
     * other policies.  To ensure that we do not hold on to worker
     * references that would prevent GC, ALL accesses to workers are
     * via indices into the workers array (which is one source of some
     * of the messy code constructions here). In essence, the workers
     * array serves as a weak reference mechanism. Thus for example
     * the wait queue field of ctl stores worker indices, not worker
     * references.  Access to the workers in associated methods (for
     * example signalWork) must both index-check and null-check the
     * IDs. All such accesses ignore bad IDs by returning out early
     * from what they are doing, since this can only be associated
     * with termination, in which case it is OK to give up.
     *
     * All uses of the workers array, as well as queue arrays, check
     * that the array is non-null (even if previously non-null). This
     * allows nulling during termination, which is currently not
     * necessary, but remains an option for resource-revocation-based
     * shutdown schemes.
     *
     * Wait Queuing. Unlike HPC work-stealing frameworks, we cannot
     * let workers spin indefinitely scanning for tasks when none can
     * be found immediately, and we cannot start/resume workers unless
     * there appear to be tasks available.  On the other hand, we must
     * quickly prod them into action when new tasks are submitted or
     * generated.  We park/unpark workers after placing in an event
     * wait queue when they cannot find work. This "queue" is actually
     * a simple Treiber stack, headed by the "id" field of ctl, plus a
     * 15bit counter value to both wake up waiters (by advancing their
     * count) and avoid ABA effects. Successors are held in worker
     * field "nextWait".  Queuing deals with several intrinsic races,
     * mainly that a task-producing thread can miss seeing (and
     * signalling) another thread that gave up looking for work but
     * has not yet entered the wait queue. We solve this by requiring
     * a full sweep of all workers both before (in scan()) and after
     * (in tryAwaitWork()) a newly waiting worker is added to the wait
     * queue. During a rescan, the worker might release some other
     * queued worker rather than itself, which has the same net
     * effect. Because enqueued workers may actually be rescanning
     * rather than waiting, we set and clear the "parked" field of
     * ForkJoinWorkerThread to reduce unnecessary calls to unpark.
     * (Use of the parked field requires a secondary recheck to avoid
     * missed signals.)
     *
     * Signalling.  We create or wake up workers only when there
     * appears to be at least one task they might be able to find and
     * execute.  When a submission is added or another worker adds a
     * task to a queue that previously had two or fewer tasks, they
     * signal waiting workers (or trigger creation of new ones if
     * fewer than the given parallelism level -- see signalWork).
     * These primary signals are buttressed by signals during rescans
     * as well as those performed when a worker steals a task and
     * notices that there are more tasks too; together these cover the
     * signals needed in cases when more than two tasks are pushed
     * but untaken.
     *
     * Trimming workers. To release resources after periods of lack of
     * use, a worker starting to wait when the pool is quiescent will
     * time out and terminate if the pool has remained quiescent for
     * SHRINK_RATE nanosecs. This will slowly propagate, eventually
     * terminating all workers after long periods of non-use.
     *
     * Submissions. External submissions are maintained in an
     * array-based queue that is structured identically to
     * ForkJoinWorkerThread queues except for the use of
     * submissionLock in method addSubmission. Unlike the case for
     * worker queues, multiple external threads can add new
     * submissions, so adding requires a lock.
     *
     * Compensation. Beyond work-stealing support and lifecycle
     * control, the main responsibility of this framework is to take
     * actions when one worker is waiting to join a task stolen (or
     * always held by) another.  Because we are multiplexing many
     * tasks on to a pool of workers, we can't just let them block (as
     * in Thread.join).  We also cannot just reassign the joiner's
     * run-time stack with another and replace it later, which would
     * be a form of "continuation", that even if possible is not
     * necessarily a good idea since we sometimes need both an
     * unblocked task and its continuation to progress. Instead we
     * combine two tactics:
     *
     *   Helping: Arranging for the joiner to execute some task that it
     *      would be running if the steal had not occurred.  Method
     *      ForkJoinWorkerThread.joinTask tracks joining->stealing
     *      links to try to find such a task.
     *
     *   Compensating: Unless there are already enough live threads,
     *      method tryPreBlock() may create or re-activate a spare
     *      thread to compensate for blocked joiners until they
     *      unblock.
     *
     * The ManagedBlocker extension API can't use helping so relies
     * only on compensation in method awaitBlocker.
     *
     * It is impossible to keep exactly the target parallelism number
     * of threads running at any given time.  Determining the
     * existence of conservatively safe helping targets, the
     * availability of already-created spares, and the apparent need
     * to create new spares are all racy and require heuristic
     * guidance, so we rely on multiple retries of each.  Currently,
     * in keeping with on-demand signalling policy, we compensate only
     * if blocking would leave less than one active (non-waiting,
     * non-blocked) worker. Additionally, to avoid some false alarms
     * due to GC, lagging counters, system activity, etc, compensated
     * blocking for joins is only attempted after rechecks stabilize
     * (retries are interspersed with Thread.yield, for good
     * citizenship).  The variable blockedCount, incremented before
     * blocking and decremented after, is sometimes needed to
     * distinguish cases of waiting for work vs blocking on joins or
     * other managed sync. Both cases are equivalent for most pool
     * control, so we can update non-atomically. (Additionally,
     * contention on blockedCount alleviates some contention on ctl).
     *
     * Shutdown and Termination. A call to shutdownNow atomically sets
     * the ctl stop bit and then (non-atomically) sets each workers
     * "terminate" status, cancels all unprocessed tasks, and wakes up
     * all waiting workers.  Detecting whether termination should
     * commence after a non-abrupt shutdown() call requires more work
     * and bookkeeping. We need consensus about quiesence (i.e., that
     * there is no more work) which is reflected in active counts so
     * long as there are no current blockers, as well as possible
     * re-evaluations during independent changes in blocking or
     * quiescing workers.
     *
     * Style notes: There is a lot of representation-level coupling
     * among classes ForkJoinPool, ForkJoinWorkerThread, and
     * ForkJoinTask.  Most fields of ForkJoinWorkerThread maintain
     * data structures managed by ForkJoinPool, so are directly
     * accessed.  Conversely we allow access to "workers" array by
     * workers, and direct access to ForkJoinTask.status by both
     * ForkJoinPool and ForkJoinWorkerThread.  There is little point
     * trying to reduce this, since any associated future changes in
     * representations will need to be accompanied by algorithmic
     * changes anyway. All together, these low-level implementation
     * choices produce as much as a factor of 4 performance
     * improvement compared to naive implementations, and enable the
     * processing of billions of tasks per second, at the expense of
     * some ugliness.
     *
     * Methods signalWork() and scan() are the main bottlenecks so are
     * especially heavily micro-optimized/mangled.  There are lots of
     * inline assignments (of form "while ((local = field) != 0)")
     * which are usually the simplest way to ensure the required read
     * orderings (which are sometimes critical). This leads to a
     * "C"-like style of listing declarations of these locals at the
     * heads of methods or blocks.  There are several occurrences of
     * the unusual "do {} while (!cas...)"  which is the simplest way
     * to force an update of a CAS'ed variable. There are also other
     * coding oddities that help some methods perform reasonably even
     * when interpreted (not compiled).
     *
     * The order of declarations in this file is: (1) declarations of
     * statics (2) fields (along with constants used when unpacking
     * some of them), listed in an order that tends to reduce
     * contention among them a bit under most JVMs.  (3) internal
     * control methods (4) callbacks and other support for
     * ForkJoinTask and ForkJoinWorkerThread classes, (5) exported
     * methods (plus a few little helpers). (6) static block
     * initializing all statics in a minimally dependent order.

     * Interface for extending managed parallelism for tasks running
     * in {@link ForkJoinPool}s.
     *
     * <p>A {@code ManagedBlocker} provides two methods.  Method
     * {@code isReleasable} must return {@code true} if blocking is
     * not necessary. Method {@code block} blocks the current thread
     * if necessary (perhaps internally invoking {@code isReleasable}
     * before actually blocking). These actions are performed by any
     * thread invoking {@link ForkJoinPool#managedBlock}.  The
     * unusual methods in this API accommodate synchronizers that may,
     * but don't usually, block for long periods. Similarly, they
     * allow more efficient internal handling of cases in which
     * additional workers may be, but usually are not, needed to
     * ensure sufficient parallelism.  Toward this end,
     * implementations of method {@code isReleasable} must be amenable
     * to repeated invocation.
     *
     * <p>For example, here is a ManagedBlocker based on a
     * ReentrantLock:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class ManagedLocker implements ManagedBlocker {
     *   final ReentrantLock lock;
     *   boolean hasLock = false;
     *   ManagedLocker(ReentrantLock lock) { this.lock = lock; }
     *   public boolean block() {
     *     if (!hasLock)
     *       lock.lock();
     *     return true;
     *   }
     *   public boolean isReleasable() {
     *     return hasLock || (hasLock = lock.tryLock());
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>Here is a class that possibly blocks waiting for an
     * item on a given queue:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * class QueueTaker<E> implements ManagedBlocker {
     *   final BlockingQueue<E> queue;
     *   volatile E item = null;
     *   QueueTaker(BlockingQueue<E> q) { this.queue = q; }
     *   public boolean block() throws InterruptedException {
     *     if (item == null)
     *       item = queue.take();
     *     return true;
     *   }
     *   public boolean isReleasable() {
     *     return item != null || (item = queue.poll()) != null;
     *   }
     *   public E getItem() { // call after pool.managedBlock completes
     *     return item;
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
