/**
 * The management interface for the operating system on which
 * the Java virtual machine is running.
 *
 * <p> A Java virtual machine has a single instance of the implementation
 * class of this interface.  This instance implementing this interface is
 * an <a href="ManagementFactory.html#MXBean">MXBean</a>
 * that can be obtained by calling
 * the {@link ManagementFactory#getOperatingSystemMXBean} method or
 * from the {@link ManagementFactory#getPlatformMBeanServer
 * platform <tt>MBeanServer</tt>} method.
 *
 * <p>The <tt>ObjectName</tt> for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
 * the operating system within an MBeanServer is:
 * <blockquote>
 *    {@link ManagementFactory#OPERATING_SYSTEM_MXBEAN_NAME
 *      <tt>java.lang:type=OperatingSystem</tt>}
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * It can be obtained by calling the
 * {@link PlatformManagedObject#getObjectName} method.
 *
 * <p> This interface defines several convenient methods for accessing
 * system properties about the operating system on which the Java
 * virtual machine is running.
 *
 * @see ManagementFactory#getPlatformMXBeans(Class)
 * @see <a href="../../../javax/management/package-summary.html">
 *      JMX Specification.</a>

 *      Ways to Access MXBeans</a>
