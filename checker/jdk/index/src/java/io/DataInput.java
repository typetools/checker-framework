/**
 * The <code>DataInput</code> interface provides
 * for reading bytes from a binary stream and
 * reconstructing from them data in any of
 * the Java primitive types. There is also
 * a
 * facility for reconstructing a <code>String</code>
 * from data in
 * <a href="#modified-utf-8">modified UTF-8</a>
 * format.
 * <p>
 * It is generally true of all the reading
 * routines in this interface that if end of
 * file is reached before the desired number
 * of bytes has been read, an <code>EOFException</code>
 * (which is a kind of <code>IOException</code>)
 * is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for
 * any reason other than end of file, an <code>IOException</code>
 * other than <code>EOFException</code> is
 * thrown. In particular, an <code>IOException</code>
 * may be thrown if the input stream has been
 * closed.
 *
 * <h4><a name="modified-utf-8">Modified UTF-8</a></h4>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of the DataInput and DataOutput interfaces represent
 * Unicode strings in a format that is a slight modification of UTF-8.
 * (For information regarding the standard UTF-8 format, see section
 * <i>3.9 Unicode Encoding Forms</i> of <i>The Unicode Standard, Version
 * 4.0</i>).
 * Note that in the following tables, the most significant bit appears in the
 * far left-hand column.
 * <p>
 * All characters in the range <code>'&#92;u0001'</code> to
 * <code>'&#92;u007F'</code> are represented by a single byte:

 * The differences between this format and the

 * <ul>
 * <li>The null byte <code>'&#92;u0000'</code> is encoded in 2-byte format

 *     embedded nulls.

    /**
     * Reads in a string that has been encoded using a
     * <a href="#modified-utf-8">modified UTF-8</a>
     * format.
     * The general contract of <code>readUTF</code>
     * is that it reads a representation of a Unicode
     * character string encoded in modified
     * UTF-8 format; this string of characters
     * is then returned as a <code>String</code>.
     * <p>
     * First, two bytes are read and used to
     * construct an unsigned 16-bit integer in
     * exactly the manner of the <code>readUnsignedShort</code>
     * method . This integer value is called the
     * <i>UTF length</i> and specifies the number
     * of additional bytes to be read. These bytes
     * are then converted to characters by considering
     * them in groups. The length of each group
     * is computed from the value of the first
     * byte of the group. The byte following a
     * group, if any, is the first byte of the
     * next group.
     * <p>
     * If the first byte of a group
     * matches the bit pattern <code>0xxxxxxx</code>
     * (where <code>x</code> means "may be <code>0</code>
     * or <code>1</code>"), then the group consists
     * of just that byte. The byte is zero-extended
     * to form a character.
     * <p>
     * If the first byte
     * of a group matches the bit pattern <code>110xxxxx</code>,
     * then the group consists of that byte <code>a</code>
     * and a second byte <code>b</code>. If there
     * is no byte <code>b</code> (because byte
     * <code>a</code> was the last of the bytes
     * to be read), or if byte <code>b</code> does
     * not match the bit pattern <code>10xxxxxx</code>,
     * then a <code>UTFDataFormatException</code>
     * is thrown. Otherwise, the group is converted
     * to the character:<p>
     * <pre><code>(char)(((a&amp; 0x1F) &lt;&lt; 6) | (b &amp; 0x3F))
     * </code></pre>
     * If the first byte of a group
     * matches the bit pattern <code>1110xxxx</code>,
     * then the group consists of that byte <code>a</code>
     * and two more bytes <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.
     * If there is no byte <code>c</code> (because
     * byte <code>a</code> was one of the last
     * two of the bytes to be read), or either
     * byte <code>b</code> or byte <code>c</code>
     * does not match the bit pattern <code>10xxxxxx</code>,
     * then a <code>UTFDataFormatException</code>
     * is thrown. Otherwise, the group is converted
     * to the character:<p>
     * <pre><code>
     * (char)(((a &amp; 0x0F) &lt;&lt; 12) | ((b &amp; 0x3F) &lt;&lt; 6) | (c &amp; 0x3F))
     * </code></pre>
     * If the first byte of a group matches the
     * pattern <code>1111xxxx</code> or the pattern
     * <code>10xxxxxx</code>, then a <code>UTFDataFormatException</code>
     * is thrown.
     * <p>
     * If end of file is encountered
     * at any time during this entire process,
     * then an <code>EOFException</code> is thrown.
     * <p>
     * After every group has been converted to
     * a character by this process, the characters
     * are gathered, in the same order in which
     * their corresponding groups were read from
     * the input stream, to form a <code>String</code>,
     * which is returned.
     * <p>
     * The <code>writeUTF</code>
     * method of interface <code>DataOutput</code>
     * may be used to write data that is suitable
     * for reading by this method.
     * @return     a Unicode string.
     * @exception  EOFException            if this stream reaches the end
     *               before reading all the bytes.
     * @exception  IOException             if an I/O error occurs.
     * @exception  UTFDataFormatException  if the bytes do not represent a
     *               valid modified UTF-8 encoding of a string.
