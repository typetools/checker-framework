/**
 * A <tt>CharSequence</tt> is a readable sequence of <code>char</code> values. This

 * A <code>char</code> value represents a character in the <i>Basic
 * Multilingual Plane (BMP)</i> or a surrogate. Refer to <a
 * href="Character.html#unicode">Unicode Character Representation</a> for details.
 *
 * <p> This interface does not refine the general contracts of the {@link
 * java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object) equals} and {@link
 * java.lang.Object#hashCode() hashCode} methods.  The result of comparing two
 * objects that implement <tt>CharSequence</tt> is therefore, in general,
 * undefined.  Each object may be implemented by a different class, and there
 * is no guarantee that each class will be capable of testing its instances
 * for equality with those of the other.  It is therefore inappropriate to use
 * arbitrary <tt>CharSequence</tt> instances as elements in a set or as keys in
 * a map. </p>
