missing.creates.mustcall.for=Method %s re-assigns the non-final, owning field %s.%s, but does not have a corresponding @CreatesMustCallFor annotation.
incompatible.creates.mustcall.for=Method %s re-assigns the non-final, owning field %s.%s, but its @CreatesMustCallFor annotation targets %s.
reset.not.owning=Calling method %s resets the must-call obligations of the expression %s, which is non-owning. Either annotate its declaration with an @Owning annotation, extract it into a local variable, or write a corresponding @CreatesMustCallFor annotation on the method that encloses this statement.
