required.method.not.called=@MustCall %s may not have been invoked on %s or any of its aliases.\nThe type of object is: %s.\nReason for going out of scope: %s
missing.creates.mustcall.for=Method %s re-assigns the non-final, owning field %s.%s, but does not have a corresponding @CreatesMustCallFor annotation.
incompatible.creates.mustcall.for=Method %s re-assigns the non-final, owning field %s.%s, but its @CreatesMustCallFor annotation targets %s.
reset.not.owning=Calling method %s resets the must-call obligations of the expression %s, which is non-owning. Either annotate its declaration with an @Owning annotation, extract it into a local variable, or write a corresponding @CreatesMustCallFor annotation on the method that encloses this statement.
creates.mustcall.for.override.invalid=Method %s cannot override method %s, which defines fewer @CreatesMustCallFor targets.\nfound:    %s\nrequired: %s
destructor.exceptional.postcondition=Method %s must resolve the must-call obligations of the owning field %s along all paths, including exceptional paths. On an exceptional path, the @EnsuresCalledMethods annotation was not satisfied.\nFound:    %s\nRequired: %s
mustcallalias.out.of.scope=This @MustCallAlias parameter might go out of scope without being assigned into an owning field of this object (if this is a constructor) or returned.\nReason for going out of scope: %s
