annotations.conflicts=A method may only have one effect annotation from @UI, @AlwaysSafe, and @PolyUI.
override.effect.invalid=A method override may only be @UI if it overrides an @UI method.\n  %s in %s\n  cannot override\n  %s in %s

override.effect.invalid.nonui=A method override may only be @UI if it overrides an @UI method (overriding non-UI instantiation of supertype).\n  %s in %s\n  cannot override\n  %s in %s
override.effect.warning.inheritance=%s in %s overrides a method with @UI effect (%s in %s) and another method with an @AlwaysSafe effect (%s in %s).  This is discouraged.
polymorphism.invalid=Only @PolyUIType types may have @PolyUIEffect methods.
inheritance.polymorphic.invalid=An effect-polymorphic type may only inherit from another effect-polymorphic type (%s extends/implements %s).
