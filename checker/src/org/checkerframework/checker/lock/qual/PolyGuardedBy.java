/**
 * A polymorphic qualifier for the GuardedBy type system.
 * Indicates that is unknown what the guards are or whether they are held.
 * An expression whose type is {@code @PolyGuardedBy} cannot be dereferenced.
 * Hence, unlike for @GuardSatisfied, when an expression of type {@code @PolyGuardedBy}
 * is the LHS of an assignment, the locks guarding the RHS do not need to be held.
 * <p>
 *
 * Any method written using {@code @PolyGuardedBy} conceptually has an
 * arbitrary number of versions:  one in which every instance of
 * {@code @PolyGuardedBy} has been replaced by {@code @}{@link GuardedByUnknown},
 * one in which every instance of {@code @PolyGuardedBy} has been
 * replaced by {@code @}{@link GuardedByBottom}, and ones in which every
 * instance of {@code @PolyGuardedBy} has been replaced by {@code @}{@link GuardedBy},
 * for every possible combination of map arguments.
 * <p>
