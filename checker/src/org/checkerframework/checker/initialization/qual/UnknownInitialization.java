/**
 * This type qualifier belongs to the freedom-before-commitment type-system for
 * tracking initialization. This type-system is not used on its own, but in
 * conjunction with some other type-system that wants to ensure safe
 * initialization. For instance, {@link NullnessChecker} uses
 * freedom-before-commitment to track initialization of {@link NonNull} fields.
 *
 * <p>
 * This type qualifier indicates that the object might not have been fully
 * initialized. An object is fully initialized when each of its fields contains
 * a value that satisfies its type qualifier. What type qualifiers are
 * considered depends on the checker; for instance, the
 * {@link NullnessChecker} considers {@link NonNull}.
 *
 * <p>
 * Therefore, reading a field of an object of type {@link UnknownInitialization}
 * might yield a value that does not correspond to the declared type qualifier
 * for that field. For instance, in the {@link NullnessChecker}, a field
 * might be {@code null} even if it has been annotated as {@link NonNull}.
 *
 * <p>
 * More precisely, an expression of type {@code @UnknownInitialization(T.class)}
 * refers to an object that has all fields of {@code T} (and any super-classes)
 * initialized (e.g., to a non-null value in the {@link NullnessChecker}).
 * Just {@code @UnknownInitialization} is equivalent to
 * {@code @UnknownInitialization(Object.class)}.
