/**
 * This type qualifier indicates that an object is (definitely) in the process of being
 * constructed/initialized. The type qualifier also indicates how much of the object has already
 * been initialized. Please see the manual for examples of how to use the annotation (the link
 * appears below).
 *
 * <p>Consider a class {@code B} that is a subtype of {@code A}. At the beginning of the constructor
 * of {@code B}, {@code this} has the type {@code @UnderInitialization(A.class)}, since all fields
 * of {@code A} have been initialized by the super-constructor. Inside the constructor body, as soon
 * as all fields of {@code B} are initialized, then the type of {@code this} changes to
 * {@code @UnderInitialization(B.class)}.
 *
 * <p>Code is allowed to store potentially not-fully-initialized objects in the fields of a
 * partially-initialized object, as long as all initialization is complete by the end of the
 * constructor.
 *
 * <p>What type qualifiers on the field are considered depends on the checker; for instance, the
 * {@link org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker} considers {@link NonNull}. The
 * initialization type system (called "freedom before commitment") is not used on its own, but in
 * conjunction with some other type-system that wants to ensure safe initialization.
 *
 * <p>When an expression has type {@code @UnderInitialization}, then no aliases that are typed
 * differently may exist.
