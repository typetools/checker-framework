### Error messages for the Upper Bound Checker
local.variable.unsafe.dependent.annotation=Dependent type annotations on local variables are not supported by the Upper Bound Checker.
dependent.not.permitted=This annotation contains an expression that is not permitted in a dependent type.\nForbidden expression: %s\nThis expression is forbidden because %s.
reassignment.not.permitted=Reassigning the variable %s is not permitted, because the annotation %s depends on it. Reassigning %s would invalidate that annotation.
reassignment.field.not.permitted=Reassigning this field may invalidate the following annotation, which names the field: %s.
side.effect.invalidation=This method may have side-effects that could affect the value of this annotation: %s. If the method does not have side effects, consider annotating it as @Pure.
reassignment.field.not.permitted.method=Reassigning this field may invalidate the following annotation, because the annotation contains a method call: %s
array.access.unsafe.high=Potentially unsafe array access: the index could be larger than the array's bound\nfound   : %s\nrequired: @IndexFor("%s") or @LTLengthOf("%s") -- an integer less than %s's length
array.access.unsafe.high.constant=Potentially unsafe array access: the constant index %s could be larger than the array's bound\nfound   : %s\nrequired: @MinLen("%s") -- an array guaranteed to have at least %s elements
array.access.unsafe.high.range=Potentially unsafe array access: the index could be larger than the array's bound\nindex type found: %s\narray type found: %s\nrequired        : index of type @IndexFor("%s") or @LTLengthOf("%s"), or array of type @MinLen("%s")
