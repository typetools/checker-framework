Coding style
------------

When editing files in the Checker Framework, see Michael Ernst's coding
style guidelines:
http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/coding-style.html

You may also wish to see Oracle's Java code conventions:

The codebase conforms to a consistent coding style, which is enforced by a git
pre-commit hook. The pre-commit hook runs "ant check-format" in the top level
directory. "ant reformat" will format all files such that check-format
succeeds.
