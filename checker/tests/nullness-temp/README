This directory is for temporary tests for the Nullness Checker

The point is that putting them here permits them to be run quickly, rather
than (say) putting them in the main nullness test suite and having to run
that entire suite.

Don't check any files into this directory, just use them in your local
copy.


To add a new file to the test suite, just add it to this directory.
For more details, see
  ../README

To run the tests, do
  (cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && ./gradlew NullnessTempTest)
