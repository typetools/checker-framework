// WARNING: this test is nondeterministic, and has already been
// minimized - if you modify it by removing what appears to be
// redundant code, it may no longer reproduce the issue or provide
// coverage for the issue after a fix for the issue has been made.

// About the nondeterminism:
// The desired behavior, with the fix for issue 524 in place, is for the test to type check without issuing any warnings.
// (Notice that there are no expected warnings below.)
// However even without a fix for issue 524 in place, the test sometimes type checks.
// Unfortunately a test case that always fails to typecheck using a Checker Framework build
// prior to the fix for issue 524 has not been found.
