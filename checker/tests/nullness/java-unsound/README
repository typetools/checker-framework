This directory discusses the examples from the paper
"Java and Scala's Type Systems are Unsound - The Existential Crisis of Null Pointers"
by Amin and Tate, OOPSLA 2016.

The un-annotated example programs all get rejected either by a Java 9+ javac or by the
Nullness Checker.

Figure3NC and Figure6NC are variations of the examples with nullness annotations.
Those versions pass the Nullness Checker, but result in ClassCastExceptions!
