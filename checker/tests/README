This document describes how to run and write tests for the Checker
Framework.  Running and writing tests is useful for Checker Framework
maintainers, checker writers, and bug submitters.  Users of the Checker
Framework and of the org.checkerframework.checker packaged with it should read the manual
instead; see file ../manual/manual.html .


How to run the tests for the Checker Framework
==============================================

  # Warning: this may rebuild the JDK
  ant -e -find build.xml all-tests

Other ant targets also exist to run a subset of the tests, without
rebuilding the JDK; for example,
  ant -e -find build.xml nullness-tests

To run an individual test (check one source code file), do something like:

  cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/nullness
  (cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && ant -e dist) && $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/bin/javac -processor org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker -implicit:class AssertNonNullTest.java

or, less commonly (to run from .class files instead of .jar file):

  cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/framework
  (cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && ant -e dist) && $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/bin/javac -processor tests.util.TestChecker -classpath $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/build -implicit:class GenericTest10.java

where the specific checker and command-line arguments are often clear from
the directory name but can also be determined from
  checker-framework/org.checkerframework.checker/tests/src/tests/MyTypeSystemTest.java


How to write test cases for the Checker Framework
=================================================

The testing framework for the Checker Framework is built on top of JUnit.
However, its tests are more like end-to-end integration tests than unit
tests.

A checker test case has two parts:
  1. the Java class to be compiled, and
  2. a set of expected errors.

Both parts can be expressed in one file that is stored in the folder
corresponding to the checker name, such as
checker-framework/org.checkerframework.checker/tests/nullness/.


Writing new tests for an existing checker
=========================================

Suppose that you want to add a test for the Nullness Checker, with the
following Java class:

class MyNullnessTest {
  void method() {
    Object nullable = null;
    nullable.toString();   // should emit error
  }
}

The Nullness Checker should report an error for the dereference in line 4.
The non-localized message key for such an error is
'dereference.of.nullable'.  You could learn that by reading the Javadoc (or
the source code) for org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessVisitor, or by creating the
test and observing the failure.

To indicate the expected failure, insert the line
  //:: error: (<error-message-key>)
directly preceding the expected error line.
If multiple errors are expected on a single line, duplicate everthing
except the "//" comment characters, as in
  //:: error: (<error-message-key1>) :: error: (<error-message-key2>)
If a warning rather than an error is expected, insert the line
  //:: warning: (<warning-message-key>)
If a stub parser warning is expected, insert the line
//warning: StubParser: <stub parser warning>

So the final test case would be:

class MyNullnessTest {
  void method() {
    Object nullable = null;
    //:: error: (dereference.of.nullable)
    nullable.toString();   // should emit error
  }
}

The file may appear anywhere in or under org.checkerframework.checker/tests/nullness/.  (You may
find it useful to use separate subfolders, such as
nullness/tests/nullness/dereference/.)  Each checker should have its own
folder under org.checkerframework.checker/tests, such as org.checkerframework.checker/tests/igj/,
org.checkerframework.checker/tests/interning/, etc.

You may wish to supply different command-line arguments (flags) to the
checker for certain test cases -- for instance, to check an optional
command-line argument that should not be enabled for every test.  To do
this:
 * create a top-level test directory, such as
   org.checkerframework.checker/tests/nullness-uninit, for the test cases
 * create a top-level JUnit test, such as:
   org.checkerframework.checker/tests/src/tests/NullnessUninitializedTest.java
 * change org.checkerframework.checker/build.xml to run those tests


Disabling a test case
=====================

Write @skip-test anywhere in a test file to disable that test.

Write @non-308-skip-test anywhere in a test file to disable that test if
the jsr308-langtools compiler is not used. (This is useful for tests that
depend on annotations-in-comments that would fail with the stock compiler.)

To disable all tests for a given type system, temporarily move away a file;
for example,
  mv $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/src/tests/OIGJTest.java $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/src/tests/OIGJTest.java-SAVE
[Is there a better way?]


Writing tests for a new checker
===============================

Essentially, just copy an existing checker, analogously to creating a new
test directory for testing different command-line arguments, as described
above.

You will thus create a new file such as 
  checker-framework/org.checkerframework.checker/tests/src/tests/MyTypeSystemTest.java
and a new directory such as 
  checker-framework/org.checkerframework.checker/tests/mytypesystem/


Annotated JDK
=============

The tests run with the annotated JDK.  Keep this in mind when writing tests.
