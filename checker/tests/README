This document describes how to write and run tests for the Checker
Framework.  Writing and running tests is useful for bug submitters,
checker writers, and Checker Framework maintainers.  Users of the Checker
Framework and of the checkers packaged with it should read the manual
instead; see file ../../docs/manual/manual.html .


How to run all the tests for the Checker Framework
==================================================

  # To run from the checker-framework directory:
  # (warning: this may rebuild the JDK, which takes a long time)
  ant -e -find build.xml tests

  # To run from the checker directory
  ant -e -find build.xml all-tests

Other ant targets also exist to run a subset of the tests, without
rebuilding the JDK; for example,
  # Run from the checker directory:
  ant -e -find build.xml nullness-tests
  ant -e -find build.xml all-tests-nobuildjdk


How to run just one test for the Checker Framework
==================================================

To run an individual test (check one source code file) without rebuilding
the JDK, do something like the following, assuming that the source code
file to be checked is AssertNonNullTest.java in directory
$CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/nullness/ and the checker is
org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker.

  cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/nullness
  (cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && ant -e build) && $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/bin-devel/javac -processor org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker -implicit:class AssertNonNullTest.java

or (to build distribution files but not the JDK)

  cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/nullness
  (cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && ant -e dist-nobuildjdk) && $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/bin-devel/javac -processor org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker -implicit:class AssertNonNullTest.java

or, less commonly (to rebuild the JDK):

  cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/framework
  (cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && ant -e dist) && $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/bin-devel/javac -processor TestChecker -implicit:class GenericTest10.java

where the specific checker and command-line arguments are often clear from
the directory name but can also be determined from a file such as
  checker-framework/checker/tests/src/tests/MyTypeSystemTest.java
which is the source code for the test itself.


Writing new tests for an existing checker
=========================================

To create a new test case, just place a Java file in the test directory,
whose name usually corresponds to the checker name, such as
checker-framework/checker/tests/nullness/ .  Unless the README file in
the test directory specifies otherwise, then the Java file must
1. Not issue any javac errors.
2. Not declare a class with the same (fully qualfied) name as any other class in
   the test directory.
3. Not declare a class with the same (simple) name as any commonly used Java
   library class such as List.

The testing framework for the Checker Framework is built on top of JUnit.
However, its tests are more like end-to-end system tests than unit tests.

A checker test case has two parts:
  1. the Java class to be compiled, and
  2. a set of expected errors.
Both parts can be expressed in one Java file.

Classes in checker-framework/framework/tests/src/tests/lib can be referenced by
tests to check behavior related to unchecked bytecode.


Specifying expected warnings and errors
=======================================

A test case is a Java file that uses stylized comments to indicate expected
error messages.

Suppose that you want to test the Nullness Checker's behavior when
type-checking the following Java class:

class MyNullnessTest {
  void method() {
    Object nullable = null;
    nullable.toString();   // should emit error
  }
}

The Nullness Checker should report an error for the dereference in line 4.
The non-localized message key for such an error is
'dereference.of.nullable'.  You could learn that by reading the Javadoc (or
the source code) for org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessVisitor,
or by creating the test and observing the failure.

To indicate the expected failure, insert the line
  // :: error: (<error-message-key>)
directly preceding the expected error line.
If multiple errors are expected on a single line, duplicate everthing
except the "//" comment characters, as in
  // :: error: (<error-message-key1>) :: error: (<error-message-key2>)
If a warning rather than an error is expected, insert the line
  // :: warning: (<warning-message-key>)
If a stub parser warning is expected, insert the line
//warning: StubParser: <stub parser warning>

So the final test case would be:

class MyNullnessTest {
  void method() {
    Object nullable = null;
    // :: error: (dereference.of.nullable)
    nullable.toString();   // should emit error
  }
}

The file may appear anywhere in or under
checker-framework/checker/tests/nullness/.  (You may find it useful to use
separate subfolders, such as nullness/tests/nullness/dereference/.)  Each
checker should have its own folder under checker-framework/checker/tests/,
such as checker-framework/checker/tests/interning/,
checker-framework/checker/tests/regex/, etc.

You can indicate an expected warning (as opposed to error) by using
"warning:" instead of "error:", as in

  // :: warning: (known.nonnull)
  assert val != null;

Multiple expected messages can be given on the same line using the
"// :: A :: B :: C" syntax.  This example expects both an error and
a warning from the same line of code:

  @Regex String s1 = null;
  // :: error: (assignment.type.incompatible) :: warning: (cast.unsafe)
  @Regex(3) String s2 = (@Regex(2) String) s;

As a alternative, expected errors can be specified in a separate file
using the .out file extension.  These files contain lines of the following
format:

:19: error: (dereference.of.nullable)

The number between the colons is the line number of the expected error
message.  This format is harder to maintain, and we suggest using the
in-line comment format.

By convention, when a test is about an issue in the issue tracker, we write
a comment at the top of the file, in this format:

  // Test case for issue 266:
  // https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/issues/266

  // @skip-test until the issue is fixed


Writing tests for a new checker or with different command-line arguments
========================================================================

To create tests for a new checker, mimic some existing checker's tests:
 * create a top-level test directory, such as
   checker-framework/checker/tests/regex for the test cases
 * create a top-level JUnit test, such as:
   checker-framework/checker/tests/src/tests/RegexTest.java
   It is a subclass of CheckerFrameworkPerDirectoryTest, and its list of checker
   options must include "-Anomsgtext".  (See the API documentation for
   CheckerFrameworkPerDirectoryTest for more detailed information.)
 * include "all-systems" as a test directy by adding it to the array created
   in getTestDirs in the new test class.  See
   checkerframework/framework/tests/all-systems/README for more details about
   the all-systems tests.
 * change checker-framework/checker/build.xml to run those tests

Different test cases may need to pass different command-line arguments
(flags) to the checker -- for instance, to check an optional command-line
argument that should not be enabled for every test.  Follow the same
instructions as for writing tests for a new checker.


Disabling a test case
=====================

Write @skip-test anywhere in a test file to disable that test.

Write @non-308-skip-test anywhere in a test file to disable that test if
the jsr308-langtools compiler is not used. (This is useful for tests that
depend on annotations-in-comments that would fail with the stock compiler.)

Write @below-java8-jdk-skip-test anywhere in a test file to disable that
test if the executing JDK version is lower than 8.
This is useful when the test depends on Java 8 language features that
need runtime support (e.g. lambdas) or depends on Java 8 APIs
(e.g. streams and reflective type annotation access).
Tests that only exercise the static type annotation API do not need
this marker, as the tests will be executed with a Java 8 compiler.

To disable all tests for a given type system, temporarily move away a file;
for example,
  mv $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/src/tests/RegexTest.java $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/tests/src/tests/RegexTest.java-SAVE
[Is there a better way?]


Annotated JDK
=============

The tests run with the annotated JDK.  Keep this in mind when writing tests.


Seeing the javac commands that are run
======================================

To see the exact javac commands that the Checker Framework test framework
runs, use
  -Demit.test.debug=true
For example:
  ant nullness-stubfile-tests -Demit.test.debug=true
This may be helpful during debugging.
