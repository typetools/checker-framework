This directory contains tests that use the jtreg testing framework.

In general it is preferred to add test cases to
checker-framework/checker/tests

There are a few cases when jtreg is appropriate:

 * It is easier to pass options to the compiler in the test file itself.
 * It is possible to check that an error message was output two times.
 * It is possible to run two separate compilation commands.
