This directory contains tests that use the jtreg testing framework.

In general it is preferred to add test cases to
checker-framework/checker/tests

There are a few cases when jtreg is appropriate:
 * The jtreg approach makes it easier to pass options to the compiler
   in the test file itself.
 * The jtreg approach makes it possible to check that an error message
   was output two times.

Sometimes jtreg is not capable of executing a test, such as when a test
uses multiple Java files.  In such a case, you will need to write your own
testing logic, as in checker-framework/checker/tests/nullness-extra/ .
