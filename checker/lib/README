This directory contains annotated versions of libraries.


Instructions for users:

During type-checking, put these jars on your classpath,
to obtain more precise type-checking with fewer false positive warnings.

If the file for the library you need is a stub file (its extension is
.astub instead of .jar), you can supply it to the checker by using
the -Astubs option, like this: -Astubs=javadoc.astub.

Instructions for people creating a new annotated library:

If you annotate a new library, please inform the Checker Framework developers
 so that they can include it in the Checker Framework distribution.

When adding a .jar or .astub file to this directory, update the below list and also
the list in ../../docs/manual/annotating-libraries.tex .
In general, old files need not be removed; that way, we accommodate users
regardless of which version of a library they wish to use.

The annotated source code appears at the following locations:

bcel.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/commons-bcel (version 5.2)
commons-bcel-6.0.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/commons-bcel
commons-io-2.5.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/commons-io
                     to build, see its file README-typetools.md
guava-19.0.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/guava
java-getopt-1.0.14.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/java-getopt

javadoc.astub models the JavaDoc classes in the JDK's com.sun.javadoc package,
which are not exposed by ct.sym and therefore cannot be part of an
annotated JDK. These are annotated for the Index and Nullness checkers.
