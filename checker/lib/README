This directory contains annotated versions of libraries.


Instructions for users:

During type-checking, put these versions on your classpath,
to obtain more precise type-checking with fewer false positive warnings.


Instructions for people creating a new annotated library:

If you annotate a new library, please inform the Checker Framework developers
 so that they can include it in the Checker Framework distribution.

When adding a .jar file to this directory, update the below list and also
the list in ../../docs/manual/annotating-libraries.tex .
In general, old files need not be removed; that way, we accommodate users
regardless of which version of a library they wish to use.

The annotated source code appears at the following locations:

bcel.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/commons-bcel (version 5.2)
commons-bcel-6.0.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/commons-bcel
guava-19.0.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/guava
java-getopt-1.0.14.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/java-getopt
