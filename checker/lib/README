This directory contains annotated versions of libraries.
During type-checking, put these versions on your classpath,
to obtain more precise type-checking with fewer false positive warnings.

When adding a .jar file to this directory, update the below list and also
the list in ../manual/annotating-libraries.tex .
In general, old files need not be removed; that way, we accommodate users
regardless of which version of a library they wish to use.

The source code appears at the following locations:

bcel-5.2.jar : from https://github.com/typetools/commons-bcel (BCEL_5_2 branch)
