## downstream tests:  projects that depend on the Checker Framework.
## These are here so they can be run by pull requests.  (Pull requests
## currently don't trigger downstream jobs.)
## Exceptions:
##  * plume-lib is run by test-plume-lib.sh
##  * daikon-typecheck is run as a separate CI project
##  * guava is run as a separate CI project

## This is moved to misc, because otherwise it would be the only work done by this script.
