This directory, "checker/bin", contains scripts to run the Checker Framework.

javac - Is a shell script that runs the Checker Framework in *nix systems
including Mac OS X.  Its invocation is equivalent to
"java -jar checker.jar <compiler arguments>".
This script is a drop-in replacement for the script javac provided by the
OpenJDK.

javac.bat - Is the equivalent of the javac script for Windows systems.


The directory "checker/dist/" houses all jars built for the binary distribution.
To build these jars, run "./gradlew assemble buildJdk" from the "checker-framework" directory.
(First, be sure you have followed the instructions for building the Checker
Framework from source (https://checkerframework.org/manual/#build-source),
including running `./gradlew cloneAndBuildDependencies`.)
Afterward, the directory will contain all jars needed to run the
Checker Framework.

checker-qual.jar - Contains the annotations used by the checkers built into the
Checker Framework

checker.jar - Contains all the Checker Framework classes including the framework
itself, all built-in checkers, and the annotations found in checker-qual.jar.

javac.jar - Contains the Type Annotations Compiler
(see https://checkerframework.org/README-jsr308.html)

jdk<x>.jar - Each jdk<x>.jar, where <x> is a major java version (e.g.,
8 or 9), contains a version of the OpenJDK annotated with Checker Framework
annotations.  Which jdk<x>.jar version is built depends on what version of
java is found in the "JAVA_HOME" environment variable.  You can also build
all versions of jdk<x>.jar by running "./gradlew buildJdk".


maven-artifacts/poms - this directory contains Maven POM files for each of the
jars that is found in the dist directory.  These POMs are used to deploy each
jar as a Maven artifact to the
https://checkerframework.org/m2-repo/ maven repository.
