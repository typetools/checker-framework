This directory, "checker/bin", contains scripts to run the Checker Framework.

javac - Is a shell script that runs the Checker Framework in *nix systems
including Mac OS X.  Its invocation is equivalent to
"java -jar checker.jar <compiler arguments>".
This script is a drop-in replacement for the script javac provided by the
OpenJDK.

javac.bat - Is the equivalent of the javac script for Windows systems.


The directory "checker/dist/" houses all jars built for the binary distribution.
To build these jars, run "./gradlew assemble" from the "checker-framework" directory.
Afterward, the directory will contain all jars needed to run the
Checker Framework.

checker-qual.jar - Contains the annotations used by the checkers built into the
Checker Framework

checker.jar - Contains all the Checker Framework classes including the framework
itself, all built-in checkers, and the annotations found in checker-qual.jar.

javac.jar - Contains the Type Annotations Compiler
(see https://checkerframework.org/README-jsr308.html)
