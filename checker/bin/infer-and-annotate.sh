#!/bin/bash

# This script runs the Checker Framework's whole-program inference
# iteratively on a program, adding type annotations to the program, until the
# .jaif files from one iteration are the same as the .jaif files from the
# previous iteration (which means there is nothing new to infer anymore).

# To use this script, the $CHECKERFRAMEWORK variable must be set to the
# Checker Framework's directory. Also, the AFU's insert-annotations-to-source
# program must be on the search path (that is, in the PATH environment variable).

# This script receives as arguments:
# 0. Any number of cmd-line arguments to insert-annotations-to-source (optional).
# 1. Processor's name (in any form recognized by CF's javac -processor argument).
# 2. Classpath (target project's classpath).
# 3. Any number of extra processor arguments to be passed to the checker.
# 4. Any number of paths to .jaif files -- used as input (optional).
# 5. Any number of paths to .java files in a program.

# Example of usage:
# ./infer-and-annotate.sh "LockChecker,NullnessChecker" \
#     plume-util/build/libs/plume-util-all.jar \
#     `find plume-util/src/main/java/ -name "*.java"`

# In case of using this script for Android projects, the classpath must include
# paths to: android.jar, gen folder, all libs used, source code folder.
# The Android project must be built with "ant debug" before running this script.

# TODO: This script deletes all .unannotated files, including ones that could
# have been generated previously by another means other than using this script.
# We must decide if we want to make a backup of previously generated
# .unannotated files, or if we want to keep the first set of generated
# .unannotated files.

# Halts the script when a nonzero value is returned from a command.
