\chapter{Generics and polymorphism\label{polymorphism}}

This chapter describes support for Java generics (also known as
``parametric polymorphism'') and polymorphism over type qualifiers.

The Checker Framework currently supports two schemes for polymorphism over
type qualifiers.

Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism} describes the
original scheme, which uses method-based annotations that are meta-annotated
with \refqualclass{framework/qual}{PolymorphicQualifier}.

\section{Generics (parametric polymorphism or type polymorphism)\label{generics}}

The Checker Framework fully supports
type-qualified Java generic types and methods (also known in the research literature as ``parametric
polymorphism'').
When instantiating a generic type,
clients supply the qualifier along with the type argument, as in
\code{List<@NonNull String>}.


\subsection{Raw types\label{generics-raw-types}}

Before running any pluggable type-checker, we recommend that you eliminate
raw types from your code (e.g., your code should use \code{List<...>} as
opposed to \code{List}).
Your code should compile without warnings when using the standard Java
compiler and the \<-Xlint:unchecked -Xlint:rawtypes> command-line options.
Using generics helps prevent type errors just as using a pluggable
type-checker does, and makes the Checker Framework's warnings easier to
understand.

If your code uses raw types, then the Checker Framework will do its best to
infer the Java type parameters and the type qualifiers.  If it infers
imprecise types that lead to type-checking warnings elsewhere, then you have
two options.  You can convert the raw types such as \code{List} to
parameterized types such as \code{List<String>}, or you can supply the
\<-AignoreRawTypeArguments> command-line option.  That option causes the
Checker Framework to ignore all subtype tests for type arguments that
were inferred for a raw type.


\subsection{Restricting instantiation of a generic class\label{generics-instantiation}}

When you define a generic class in Java, the \<extends> clause
of the generic type parameter (known as the ``upper bound'') requires that
the corresponding type argument must be a subtype of the bound.
For example, given the definition
\verb|class G<T extends Number> {...}|,
the upper bound is \<Number>
and a client can instantiate it as \code{G<Number>} or \code{G<Integer>}
but not \code{G<Date>}.

You can write a type qualifier on the \<extends> clause to make the upper
bound a qualified type.  For example, you can declare that a generic list class can hold only non-null values:
% Similarly, a generic map
% class might indicate it requires an immutable key type, but that it
% supports both nullable and non-null value types.

\begin{Verbatim}
  class MyList<T extends @NonNull Object> {...}

  MyList<@NonNull String> m1;       // OK
  MyList<@Nullable String> m2;      // error
\end{Verbatim}

That is, in the above example, all
arguments that replace \code{T} in \code{MyList<T>} must be subtypes of
\code{@NonNull Object}.

Conceptually, each generic type parameter has two bounds --- a lower bound
and an upper bound --- and at instantiation, the type argument must be
within the bounds.  Java only allows you to specify the upper bound; the
lower bound is implicitly the bottom type \<void>.  The Checker Framework
gives you more power:  you can specify both an upper and lower bound for
type parameters and wildcards.  For the upper bound, write a type qualifier
on the \<extends> clause, and for the lower bound, write a type qualifier
on the type variable.

\begin{Verbatim}
  class MyList<@LowerBound T extends @UpperBound Object> { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

For a concrete example, recall the type system of the Regex Checker (see
Figure~\refwithpage{regex-checker}) in which
 \<@Regex(0)> :>
 \<@Regex(1)> :>
 \<@Regex(2)> :>
 \<@Regex(3)> :> \ldots.

\begin{Verbatim}
  class MyRegexes<@Regex(5) T extends @Regex(1) String> { ... }

  MyRegexes<@Regex(0) String> mu;   // error - @Regex(0) is not a subtype of @Regex(1)
  MyRegexes<@Regex(1) String> m1;   // OK
  MyRegexes<@Regex(3) String> m3;   // OK
  MyRegexes<@Regex(5) String> m5;   // OK
  MyRegexes<@Regex(6) String> m6;   // error - @Regex(6) is not a supertype of @Regex(5)
\end{Verbatim}

The above declaration states that the upper bound of the type variable
is \<@Regex(1) String> and the lower bound is \<@Regex(5) void>.  That is,
arguments that replace \code{T} in \code{MyList<T>} must be subtypes of
\code{@Regex(1) String} and supertypes of \code{@Regex(5) void}.
Since \<void> cannot be used to instantiate a generic class, \<MyList> may
be instantiated with \<@Regex(1) String> through \<@Regex(5) String>.


To specify an exact bound, place the same annotation on both bounds.  For example:

\begin{Verbatim}
  class MyListOfNonNulls<@NonNull T extends @NonNull Object> { ... }
  class MyListOfNullables<@Nullable T extends @Nullable Object> { ... }

  MyListOfNonNulls<@NonNull Number> v1;      // OK
  MyListOfNonNulls<@Nullable Number> v2;     // error
  MyListOfNullables<@NonNull Number> v4;     // error
  MyListOfNullables<@Nullable Number> v3;    // OK
\end{Verbatim}

It is an error if the lower bound is not a subtype of the upper bound.

%BEGIN LATEX
\begin{smaller}
%END LATEX
\begin{Verbatim}
  class MyClass<@Nullable T extends @NonNull Object>  // error: @Nullable is not a supertype of @NonNull
\end{Verbatim}
%BEGIN LATEX
\end{smaller}
%END LATEX


\subsubsection{Defaults\label{generics-defaults}}
If the \<extends> clause is omitted,
then the upper bound defaults to \<@\emph{TopType} Object>.
If no type annotation is written on the type parameter name,
then the lower bound defaults to \<@\emph{BottomType} void>.
If the \<extends> clause is written but contains no type qualifier,
then the normal defaulting rules apply to the type in the \<extends>
clause (see Section~\ref{climb-to-top}).

These rules mean that even though in Java the following two declarations
are equivalent:

\begin{Verbatim}
  class MyClass<T>
  class MyClass<T extends Object>
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
they may specify different type qualifiers on the upper bound, depending on
the type system's defaulting rules.
% Cross-reference to the justification for this?

%% Mike is concerned that an exhaustive example here would take too
%% much space for not enough benefit.


\subsection{Type annotations on a use of a generic type variable\label{type-variable-use}}

A type annotation on a use of a generic type variable overrides/ignores any type
qualifier (in the same type hierarchy) on the corresponding actual type
argument.  For example, suppose that \code{T} is a formal type parameter.
Then using \code{@Nullable T} within the scope of \code{T} applies the type
qualifier \code{@Nullable} to the (unqualified) Java type of \code{T}\@.
This feature is only rarely used.

Here is an example of applying a type annotation to a generic type
variable:

\begin{Verbatim}
  class MyClass2<T> {
    ...
    @Nullable T myField = null;
    ...
  }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The type annotation does not restrict how \code{MyClass2} may be
instantiated.  In other words, both
\code{MyClass2<@NonNull String>} and \code{MyClass2<@Nullable String>} are
legal, and in both cases \code{@Nullable T} means \code{@Nullable String}.
In \code{MyClass2<@Interned String>},
\code{@Nullable T} means \code{@Nullable @Interned String}.

% Note that a type annotation on a generic type variable does not act like
% other type qualifiers.  In both cases the type annotation acts as a type
% constructor, but as noted above they act slightly differently.


% %% This isn't quite right because a type qualifier is itself a type
% %% constructor.
% More formally, a type annotation on a generic type variable acts as a type
% constructor rather than a type qualifier.  Another example of a type
% constructor is \code{[]}.  Just as \code{T[]} is not the same type as
% \code{T}, \code{@Nullable T} is not (necessarily) the same type as
% \code{T}.


\subsection{Annotations on wildcards\label{annotations-on-wildcards}}

At an instantiation of a generic type, a Java wildcard indicates that some
constraints are known on the type argument, but the type argument is not known
exactly.
For example, you can indicate that the type parameter for variable \<ls> is
some unknown subtype of \<CharSequence>:

\begin{Verbatim}
  List<? extends CharSequence> ls;
  ls = new ArrayList<String>();      // OK
  ls = new ArrayList<Integer>();     // error: Integer is not a subtype of CharSequence
\end{Verbatim}

For more details about wildcards, see the
\href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/wildcards.html}{Java
  tutorial on wildcards} or
\href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.5.1}{JLS
  \S 4.5.1}.

You can write a type annotation on the bound of a wildcard:

\begin{Verbatim}
  List<? extends @NonNull CharSequence> ls;
  ls = new ArrayList<@NonNull String>();    // OK
  ls = new ArrayList<@Nullable String>();   // error: @Nullable is not a subtype of @NonNull
\end{Verbatim}

Conceptually, every wildcard has two bounds --- an upper bound and a lower
bound.  Java only permits you to write the upper bound (with
\code{<?\ extends SomeType>}) or the lower bound (with \code{<?\ super
  OtherType>}), but not both; the unspecified bound is implicitly the
top type
\<Object> or the bottom type \<void>.  The Checker Framework is more
flexible:  it lets you simultaneously write annotations on both the top and
the bottom type.  To annotate the implicit bound, write the type annotation
before the \<?>.  For example:

\begin{Verbatim}
  List<@LowerBound ? extends @UpperBound CharSequence> lo;
  List<@UpperBound ? super @NonNull Number> ls;
\end{Verbatim}

For an unbounded wildcard (\code{<?>}, with neither
bound specified), the annotation in front of a wildcard applies
to both bounds.  The following three declarations are equivalent (except
that you cannot write the bottom type \<void>; note that
\sunjavadoc{java/lang/Void.html}{Void} does not denote the bottom type):

\begin{Verbatim}
  List<@NonNull ?> lnn;
  List<@NonNull ? extends @NonNull Object> lnn;
  List<@NonNull ? super @NonNull void> lnn;
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
Note that the annotation in front of a type parameter always applies to its
lower bound, because type parameters can only be written with \<extends>
and never \<super>.


% Defaults are as for type variables (see Section~\ref{generics-defaults}),
% with one exception.

The defaulting rules for
wildcards also differ from those of type parameters (see
Section~\ref{inherited-wildcard-annotations}).


%% Mike isn't sure that this section pulls its weight, especially since it
%% doesn't justify why it is desirable to be able to constrain both the
%% upper and the lower bound of a type.  If readers believe that, they will
%% be OK with the syntax.
% \subsubsection{Type parameter declaration annotation rationale\label{type-parameter-rationale}}
%
% It is desirable to be able to constrain both the upper and the lower bound
% of a type, as in
%
% \begin{Verbatim}
%   class MyClass<T extends @C MyUpperBound super @D void> { ... }
% \end{Verbatim}
%
% However, doing so is not possible due to two limitations of Java's syntax.
% First, it is illegal to specify both the upper and the lower bound of a
% type parameter or wildcard.
% Second, it is impossible to specify a type annotation for a lower
% bound without also specifying a type (use of \<void> is illegal).
%
% Thus, when you wish to specify both bounds, you write one of them
% explicitly, and you write the other one in front of the type variable name
% or \<?>.  When you wish to specify two identical bounds, you write a
% single annotation in front of the type variable name or \<?>.


\subsection{Examples of qualifiers on a type parameter\label{type-parameter-qualifier-examples}}

Recall that \<@Nullable \emph{X}> is a supertype of \<@NonNull \emph{X}>,
for any \emph{X}\@.
Most of of the following types mean different things:

\begin{Verbatim}
  class MyList1<@Nullable T> { ... }
  class MyList1a<@Nullable T extends @Nullable Object> { ... } // same as MyList1
  class MyList2<@NonNull T extends @NonNull Object> { ... }
  class MyList2a<T extends @NonNull Object> { ... } // same as MyList2
  class MyList3<T extends @Nullable Object> { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

\<MyList1> and \<MyList1a> must be instantiated with a nullable type.
The implementation of \<MyList1> must be able to consume (store) a null
value and produce (retrieve) a null value.

\<MyList2> and \<MyList2a> must be instantiated with non-null type.
The implementation of \<MyList2> has to account for only non-null values --- it
does not have to account for consuming or producing null.

\<MyList3> may be instantiated either way:
with a nullable type or a non-null type.  The implementation of \<MyList3> must consider
that it may be instantiated either way --- flexible enough to support either
instantiation, yet rigorous enough to impose the correct constraints of the
specific instantiation.  It must also itself comply with the constraints of
the potential instantiations.

One way to express the difference among \<MyList1>, \<MyList2>, and
\<MyList3> is by comparing what expressions are legal in the implementation
of the list --- that is, what expressions may appear in the ellipsis in the
declarations above, such as inside a method's body.  Suppose each class
has, in the ellipsis, these declarations:

\begin{Verbatim}
  T t;
  @Nullable T nble;      // Section "Type annotations on a use of a generic type variable", below,
  @NonNull T nn;         // further explains the meaning of "@Nullable T" and "@NonNull T".
  void add(T arg) { }
  T get(int i) { }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
Then the following expressions would be legal, inside a given
implementation --- that is, also within the ellipses.
(Compilable source code appears as file
\<checker-framework/checker/tests/nullness/generics/GenericsExample.java>.)

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
                        & MyList1 & MyList2 & MyList3 \\ \hline
  t = null;             & OK      & error   & error   \\ \hline
  t = nble;             & OK      & error   & error   \\ \hline
  nble = null;          & OK      & OK      & OK      \\ \hline
  nn = null;            & error   & error   & error   \\ \hline
  t = this.get(0);      & OK      & OK      & OK      \\ \hline
  nble = this.get(0);   & OK      & OK      & OK      \\ \hline
  nn = this.get(0);     & error   & OK      & error   \\ \hline
  this.add(t);          & OK      & OK      & OK      \\ \hline
  this.add(nble);       & OK      & error   & error   \\ \hline
  this.add(nn);         & OK      & OK      & OK      \\ \hline
\end{tabular}


%% This text is not very helpful.
% The
% implementation of \code{MyList2} may only place non-null objects in the
% list and may assume that retrieved elements are non-null.  The
% implementation of \code{MyList3} is similar in that it may only place
% non-null objects in the list, because it might be instantiated as, say,
% \code{MyList3<@NonNull Date>}.  When retrieving elements from the list,
% the implementation of \code{MyList3} must account for the fact that
% elements of \code{MyList3} may be null, because it might be instantiated
% as, say, \code{MyList3<@Nullable Date>}.
The differences are more
significant when the qualifier hierarchy is more complicated than just
\<@Nullable> and \<@NonNull>.

\subsection{Covariant type parameters\label{covariant-type-parameters}}

Java types are \emph{invariant} in their type parameter.  This means that
\code{A<X>} is a subtype of \code{B<Y>} only if \<X> is identical to \<Y>.  For
example, \code{ArrayList<Number>} is a subtype of \code{List<Number>}, but
neither \code{ArrayList<Integer>} nor \code{List<Integer>} is a subtype of
\code{List<Number>}.  (If they were, there would be a type hole in the Java
type system.)  For the same reason, type parameter annotations are treated
invariantly.  For example, \code{List<@Nullable String>} is not a subtype
of \code{List<String>}.

When a type parameter is used in a read-only way --- that is, when values
of that type are read but are never assigned --- then it is safe for the
type to be \emph{covariant} in the type parameter.  Use the \refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{Covariant} annotation to indicate
this.
When a type parameter is covariant, two instantiations of the class with
different type arguments have the same subtyping relationship as the type
arguments do.

For example, consider \<Iterator>.  Its elements can be read but not
written, so \code{Iterator<@Nullable String>} can be a subtype of
\code{Iterator<String>} without introducing a hole in the type system.
Therefore, its type parameter is annotated with \<@Covariant>.
The first type parameter of \<Map.Entry> is also covariant.
Another example would be the type parameter of a hypothetical class
\<ImmutableList>.

The \<@Covariant> annotation is trusted but not checked.
If you incorrectly specify as covariant a type parameter that that can be
written (say, the class performs a
\<set> operation or some other mutation on an object of that type), then
you have created an unsoundness in the type system.
For example, it would be incorrect to annotate the type parameter of
\<ListIterator> as covariant, because \<ListIterator> supports a \<set>
operation.


\subsection{Method type argument inference and type qualifiers\label{infer-method-type-qualifiers}}

Sometimes method type argument inference does not interact well with
type qualifiers. In such situations, you might need to provide
explicit method type arguments, for which the syntax is as follows:

\begin{alltt}
    Collections.</*@MyTypeAnnotation*/ Object>sort(l, c);
\end{alltt}

\noindent
This uses Java's existing syntax for specifying a method call's type arguments.



\section{Qualifier polymorphism\label{qualifier-polymorphism}}

The Checker Framework supports type \emph{qualifier} polymorphism for
methods, which permits a single method to have multiple different qualified
type signatures.  This is similar to Java's generics, but is used in
situations where you cannot use Java generics.  If you can use generics,
you typically do not need to use a polymorphic qualifier such as \<@PolyNull>.

To \emph{use} a polymorphic qualifier, just write it on a type.
For example, you can write \<@PolyNull> anywhere in a method that you would write
\<@NonNull> or \<@Nullable>.
A polymorphic qualifier can be used in a method signature or body.
It may not be used on a class or field.

A method written using a polymorphic qualifier conceptually has multiple
versions, somewhat like the generics feature of Java or a template in C++.
In each version, each instance of the polymorphic qualifier has been
replaced by the same other qualifier from the hierarchy.  See the examples
below in Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism-examples}.

The method body must type-check with all signatures.  A method call is
type-correct if it type-checks under any one of the signatures.  If a call
matches multiple signatures, then the compiler uses the most specific
matching signature for the purpose of type-checking.  This is the same as
Java's rule for resolving overloaded methods.

To \emph{define} a polymorphic qualifier, mark the definition with
\refqualclass{framework/qual}{PolymorphicQualifier}.  For example,
\refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{PolyNull} is a polymorphic type
qualifier for the Nullness type system:

\begin{Verbatim}
  @PolymorphicQualifier
  @Target({ElementType.TYPE_USE, ElementType.TYPE_PARAMETER})
  public @interface PolyNull { }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
See Section~\ref{polyall} for a way you can sometimes avoid defining a new
polymorphic qualifier.


\subsection{Examples of using polymorphic qualifiers\label{qualifier-polymorphism-examples}}

As an example of the use of \<@PolyNull>, method
\sunjavadoc{java/lang/Class.html\#cast-java.lang.Object-}{Class.cast}
returns null if and only if its argument is \<null>:

\begin{Verbatim}
  @PolyNull T cast(@PolyNull Object obj) { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
This is like writing:

\begin{Verbatim}
   @NonNull T cast( @NonNull Object obj) { ... }
  @Nullable T cast(@Nullable Object obj) { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
except that the latter is not legal Java, since it defines two
methods with the same Java signature.


As another example, consider

\begin{Verbatim}
  // Returns null if either argument is null.
  @PolyNull T max(@PolyNull T x, @PolyNull T y);
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
which is like writing

\begin{Verbatim}
   @NonNull T max( @NonNull T x,  @NonNull T y);
  @Nullable T max(@Nullable T x, @Nullable T y);
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
At a call site, the most specific applicable signature is selected.

Another way of thinking about which one of the two \code{max} variants is
selected is that the nullness annotations of (the declared types of) both
arguments are \emph{unified} to a type that is a supertype of both, also
known as the \emph{least upper bound} or lub.  If both
arguments are \code{@NonNull}, their unification (lub) is \<@NonNull>, and the
method return type is \<@NonNull>.  But if even one of the arguments is \<@Nullable>,
then the unification (lub) is \<@Nullable>, and so is the return type.



\subsection{Relationship to subtyping and generics\label{qualifier-polymorhism-vs-subtyping}}

Qualifier polymorphism has the same purpose and plays the same role as
Java's generics.  If a method is written using generics, it usually does
not need qualifier polymorphism.  If you have legacy code that is not
written generically, and you cannot change it to use generics, then you can
use qualifier polymorphism to achieve a similar effect, with respect to
type qualifiers only.  The base Java types are still treated non-generically.

Why not use ordinary subtyping to handle qualifier polymorphism?
Ordinarily, when you want a method to work on multiple types, you can just
use Java's subtyping.  For example, the \<equals> method is declared to
take an \<Object> as its first formal parameter, but it can be called on a
\<String> or a \<Date> because those are subtypes of \<Object>.

In most cases, the same subtyping mechanism works with type qualifiers.
\<String> is a supertype of \<@Interned String>, so a method \<toUpperCase>
that is declared to take a \<String> parameter can also be called on a
\<@Interned String> argument.

You use qualifier polymorphism in the same cases when you would use Java's
generics.  (If you can use Java's generics, then that is often better and
you don't also need to use qualifier polymorphism.)  One example is when
you want a method to operate on collections with different types of
elements.  Another example is when you want two different formal parameters
to be of the same type, without constraining them to be one specific type.


\subsection{The \code{@PolyAll} qualifier applies to every type system\label{polyall}}

Each type system has its own polymorphic type qualifier.
If some method is qualifier-polymorphic over every type qualifier
hierarchy, then it is tedious, and leads to an explosion in the number of
type annotations, to place every \<@Poly*> qualifier on that method.

For example, a method that only performs \<==> on array elements will work
no matter what the array's element types are:

\begin{Verbatim}
  /**
   * Searches for the first occurrence of the given element in the array,
   * testing for equality using == (not the equals method).
   */
  public static int indexOfEq(@PolyAll Object[] a, @Nullable Object elt) {
    for (int i=0; i<a.length; i++) {
      if (elt == a[i]) {
        return i;
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
\end{Verbatim}


\subsection{Multiple instances of polymorphic qualifiers (the index argument)\label{qualifier-polymorphism-multiple-instances}}

% TODO: Polymorphic qualifiers such as @PolyAll do not yet take an optional argument.

Each polymorphic qualifier such as \refqualclass{framework/qual}{PolyAll}
takes an optional argument so that you can
specify multiple, independent polymorphic type qualifiers.  For example,
this signature is overly restrictive:

\begin{Verbatim}
  /**
   * Returns true if the arrays are elementwise equal,
   * testing for equality using == (not the equals method).
   */
  public static int eltwiseEqualUsingEq(@PolyAll Object[] a, @PolyAll Object elt) {
    for (int i=0; i<a.length; i++) {
      if (elt != a[i]) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
That signature requires the element type annotation to be identical for the
two arguments.  For example, it forbids this invocation:

\begin{Verbatim}
  @Nullable Object[] x;
   @NonNull Object   y;
  ... indexOf(x, y) ...
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
A better signature lets the two arrays' element types vary independently:

\begin{Verbatim}
  public static int eltwiseEqualUsingEq(@PolyAll(1) Object[] a, @PolyAll(2) Object elt)
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
Note that in this case, the \<@Nullable> annotation on \<elt>'s type is no
longer necessary, since it is subsumed by \<@PolyAll>.

The \<@PolyAll> annotation at a location $l$ applies to every type
qualifier hierarchy for which no explicit qualifier is written at location
$l$.  For example, a declaration like
\<@PolyAll @NonNull Object elt> is polymorphic over every type system
\emph{except} the nullness type system, for which the type is fixed at
\<@NonNull>.  That would be the proper declaration for \<elt> if the body
had used \<elt.equals(a[i])> instead of \<elt == a[i]>.


% Suppose that some type system has two qualifiers, such as
% \<@Nullable> and \<@NonNull>.  When a polymorphic type qualifier such
% as \<@PolyNull> is used in a method, then the method conceptually
% has two different versions:  one in which every instance of
% \<@PolyNull> has been replaced by \<@NonNull> and one in
% which every instance of \<@PolyNull> has been replaced by
% \<@Nullable>.

If a method signature contains only indexless versions of a polymorphic
qualifier such as \refqualclass{framework/qual}{PolyAll} or
\refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{PolyNull}, then all of them refer to
the same type as described in
Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism-multiple-qualifiers}.  If any indexed
version appears, then every occurrence of the polymorphic qualifier without
an index is considered to use a fresh index.  For example, the following
two declarations are equivalent (where \<@PA> means \<@PolyAll>, for brevity):

\begin{smaller}
\begin{Verbatim}
  @PA(1) foo(@PA(1) Object a, @PA(2) Object b, @PA(2) Object c, @PA    Object d, @PA    Object e) {...}

  @PA(1) foo(@PA(1) Object a, @PA(2) Object b, @PA(2) Object c, @PA(3) Object d, @PA(4) Object e) {...}
\end{Verbatim}
\end{smaller}

As described in Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism-return-type}, the
qualifier on a return type must be the same as that on some formal parameter.
Therefore, the first of these declarations is legal because it is
equivalent to the second, but the third is illegal because it it
equivalent to the fourth.

\begin{Verbatim}
  @PolyAll    m1(@PolyAll    Object a, @PolyAll    Object b) { ... } // OK
  @PolyAll(1) m2(@PolyAll(1) Object a, @PolyAll(1) Object b) { ... } // OK (same as m1)

  @PolyAll    m3(@PolyAll    Object a, @PolyAll(1) Object b) { ... } // illegal
  @PolyAll(2) m4(@PolyAll(3) Object a, @PolyAll(1) Object b) { ... } // illegal (same as m3)

\subsection{Using multiple polymorphic qualifiers in a method signature\label{qualifier-polymorphism-multiple-qualifiers}}

%% I can't think of a non-clumsy way to say this.
% Each method containing a polymorphic qualifier is (conceptually) expanded
% into multiple versions completely independently.

Usually, it does not make sense to write only a single instance of a polymorphic
qualifier in a method definition:  if you write one instance of (say)
\<@PolyNull>, then you should use at least two.
(Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism-single-qualifier} describes some
exceptions to this rule:  times when it makes sense to write a single
polymorphic qualifier in a signature.)

For example, there is no point to writing

\begin{Verbatim}
  void m(@PolyNull Object obj)
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
which expands to

\begin{Verbatim}
  void m(@NonNull Object obj)
  void m(@Nullable Object obj)
\end{Verbatim}

This is no different (in terms of which calls to the method will
type-check) than writing just

\begin{Verbatim}
  void m(@Nullable Object obj)
\end{Verbatim}

The main benefit of polymorphic qualifiers comes when one is used multiple times
in a method, since then each instance turns into the same type qualifier.
Most frequently, the polymorphic qualifier appears on at least one formal
parameter and also on the return type.  It can also be useful to have
polymorphic qualifiers on (only) multiple formal parameters, especially if
the method side-effects one of its arguments.
For example, consider

\begin{Verbatim}
void moveBetweenStacks(Stack<@PolyNull Object> s1, Stack<@PolyNull Object> s2) {
  s1.push(s2.pop());
}
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
In this example, if it is acceptable to rewrite your code to use Java
generics, the code can be even cleaner:

\begin{Verbatim}
<T> void moveBetweenStacks(Stack<T> s1, Stack<T> s2) {
  s1.push(s2.pop());
}
\end{Verbatim}

\label{qualifier-polymorphism-return-type}
It is permitted to write a polymorphic qualifier on a return type only if
that polymorphic qualifier appeared elsewhere in the signature, on some
formal parameter.

%% It would be nice to give an example that isn't too contrived.


\subsection{Using a single polymorphic qualifier in a method signature\label{qualifier-polymorphism-single-qualifier}}

As explained in Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism-multiple-qualifiers},
you will usually use a polymorphic qualifier
multiple times in a signature.
This section describes situations when it makes sense to write just one
polymorphic qualifier in a method signature.
Some of these situations can be avoided by writing a generic method,
but in legacy code it may not be possible for you to change a method to be
generic.


\subsubsection{Using a single polymorphic qualifier on an element type\label{qualifier-polymorphism-element-types}}

It can make sense to use a polymorphic qualifier just once, on an array or
generic element type.

For example, consider a routine that returns the index, in an array, of a
given element:

\begin{Verbatim}
  public static int indexOf(@PolyNull Object[] a, @Nullable Object elt) { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

If \<@PolyNull> were replaced with either \<@Nullable> or \<@NonNull>, then
one of these safe client calls would be rejected:

\begin{Verbatim}
  @Nullable Object[] a1;
  @NonNull Object[] a2;

  indexOf(a1, someObject);
  indexOf(a2, someObject);
\end{Verbatim}

Of course, it would be better style to use a generic method, as in either
of these signatures:

\begin{Verbatim}
 public static <T extends @Nullable Object> int indexOf(T[] a, @Nullable Object elt) { ... }
 public static <T extends @Nullable Object> int indexOf(T[] a, T elt) { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

The examples in this section use arrays, but analogous examples exist that
use collections.


\subsubsection{Using a single polymorphic qualifier to indicate all arguments are legal\label{qualifier-polymorphism-top-type}}

A single \<@PolyAll> annotation can indicate that any possible value is
permitted to be passed.  For example:

\begin{Verbatim}
  boolean eq(@PolyAll Object other) {
    return this == other;
  }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The \<@PolyAll> annotation applies to all type systems.
It would be infeasible to write the top qualifier for every possible type
system and to update this method's annotation whenever a new type system is
defined.

By contrast, a declaration of \<eq> without \<@PolyAll>:

\begin{Verbatim}
  boolean eq(Object other) {
    return this == other;
  }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
would reject some calls, in type systems where the default type qualifier
applied to \<Object> is not the top type.

A related use of a single polymorphic qualifier is to override a generic
type.  For example, the annotation on
\sunjavadoc{java/lang/Comparable.html\#compareTo-T-}{Comparable.compareTo()}
is:

\begin{Verbatim}
  public interface Comparable<T extends @NonNull Object> {
    @Pure int compareTo(@PolyAll @NonNull T a1);
  }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
which indicates that, for every type system other than the nullness type
system, every value is permitted as an argument, regardless of how the
\<Comparable> type was instantiated.  For example, this call is legal:

\begin{Verbatim}
  Comparable<@MyBottom String> cble;
  @MyTop String s;
  ...
  cble.compareTo(s);
\end{Verbatim}
