Necessary changes to the manual.

------------------------------------------------------
The warning output now contains the most specific error key that
can be used to suppress that warning.
Update all example output in the manual to account for this.

New section on concepts and annotations that apply to all type-systems and checkers

Where would a good place be for this?  At the beginning/end?  Split into multiple sections?

- Pre-/postconditions from a user perspective:
  - Explain the generic pre- and postcondition annotations: @EnsuresAnnotation/@EnsuresAnnotations, @EnsuresAnnotationIf/@EnsuresAnnotationsIf and @RequiresAnnotation/@RequiresAnnotations.
  - Explain what kind of strings are supported (see text near the end of this documentat; use that to augment the existing Checker Framework documentation).

- Pre-/postconditions from a developer perspective:
  - Explain the meta-annotations @PreconditionAnnotation, @ConditionalPostconditionAnnotation and @PostconditionAnnotation.

- Document -ANullnessChecker_option=value mechanism

------------------------------------------------------

The Javadoc for DefaultQualifieers uses ALL_EXCEPT_LOCALS in an example.
Replace it and document how to achieve CLIMB-to-top instead.

------------------------------------------------------

Explain relationship between XXXChecker and XXXAnnotatedTypeFactory:  if
the Checker is a subtype of BaseTypeChecker, the AnnotatedTypeFactory has
to be a subtype of AbstractBasicAnnotatedTypeFactory, because
BaseTypeVisitor assumes that.
[Defer this because it is being rewritten.]

Basic* is gone.
Base* (in checker-framework/framework/src/org/checkerframework/common/basetype) does:
 * subtype tests
 * type validation
 * default annotations
 * visitor
 * etc.

------------------------------------------------------

Eclipse setup
-------------
Describe checker-framework.importorder and formatter.
Should these developer-focused configs be moved somewhere else?
