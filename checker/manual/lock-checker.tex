\chapter{Lock Checker\label{lock-checker}}

The Lock Checker prevents certain concurrency errors by enforcing a
locking discipline.  A locking discipline indicates which locks must be held
when a given operation occurs.  You express the locking discipline by
declaring variable's type to have the qualifier
\<\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardedBy}{\small("\emph{lockexpr}")}>.
This indicates that the variable's value may
be dereferenced only if the given lock is held.


To run the Lock Checker, supply the
\code{-processor org.checkerframework.checker.lock.LockChecker}
command-line option to javac.


\section{What the Lock Checker guarantees\label{lock-guarantees}}

The Lock Checker gives the following guarantee.
Suppose that expression $e$ has type
\<\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardedBy}(\ttlcb"x", "y.z"\ttrcb)>.
Then the value computed for $e$ is only dereferenced by a thread when the
thread holds locks \<x> and \<y.z>.
Dereferencing a value is reading or writing one of its fields.
The guarantee holds not only if the expression $e$ is dereferenced
directly, but also if the value was first copied into a variable,
returned as the
result of a method call, etc.
Copying a reference is always
permitted by the Lock Checker, regardless of which locks are held.

A lock is held if it has been acquired but not yet released.
Java has two types of locks.
A monitor lock is acquired upon entry to a \<synchronized> method or block,
and is released on exit from that method or block.
%  (More precisely,
%  the current thread locks the monitor associated with the value of
%  \emph{E}; see \href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.1}{JLS \S17.1}.)
An explicit lock is acquired by a method call such as
\sunjavadoc{java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html\#lock()}{Lock.lock()},
and is released by another method call such as
\sunjavadoc{java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html\#unlock()}{Lock.unlock()}.
The Lock Checker enforces that any expression whose type implements
\sunjavadoc{java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html}{Lock} is used as an
explicit lock, and all other expressions are used as monitor locks.

Ensuring that your program obeys its locking discipline is an easy and
effective way to eliminate a common and important class of errors.
If the Lock Checker issues no warnings, then your program obeys its locking discipline.
However, your program might still have other types of concurrency errors.
%
For example, you might have specified an inadequate locking discipline
because you forgot some \refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardedBy}
annotations.
%
Your program might release and
re-acquire the lock, when correctness requires it to hold it throughout a
computation.
%
And, there are other concurrency errors that cannot, or
should not, be solved with locks.


\section{Lock annotations\label{lock-annotations}}

This section describes the lock annotations you can write on types and methods.


\subsection{Type qualifiers\label{lock-type-qualifiers}}

\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardedBy}{\small(\emph{exprSet})}]
  If a variable \<x> has type \<@GuardedBy("\emph{expr}")>, then a thread may
  dereference the value referred to by \<x> only when the thread holds the
  lock that \emph{expr} currently evaluates to.

  The \<@GuardedBy> annotation can list multiple expressions, as in
  \<@GuardedBy(\ttlcb"\emph{expr1}", "\emph{expr2}"\ttrcb)>, in which case
  the dereference is
  permitted only if the thread holds all the locks.

  \<@GuardedBy(\{\})> is the default type qualifier for all locations
  except method formal parameters (including the receiver parameter)
  if the programmer does not
  write an explicit locking type qualifier.
  \textcolor{red}{JT: The best default for each location will be decided on after performing
  additional experiments.}

\item[\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardedByInaccessible}]
  If a variable \<x> has type \code{@GuardedByInaccessible}, then
  the value referred to by \<x> can never be accessed.
  This annotation is used internally by the type system
  and should never be written by a programmer.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardedByBottom}]
  If a variable \<x> has type \code{@GuardedByBottom}, then
  the value referred to by \<x> is \code{null}.
  This annotation is used internally by the type system
  and should never be written by a programmer.

\end{description}

Figure~\ref{fig-lock-guardedby-hierarchy} shows the type hierarchy of these
qualifiers.
All \code{@GuardedBy} annotations are incomparable:
if \emph{exprSet1} $\neq$ \emph{exprSet2}, then \code{@GuardedBy(\emph{exprSet1})} and
\code{@GuardedBy(\emph{exprSet2})} are siblings in the type hierarchy.
You might expect that
\<@GuardedBy({"x", "y"}) T> is a subtype of \<@GuardedBy({"x"}) T>.  The
first type requires two locks to be held, and the second requires only one
lock to be held and so could be used in any situation where both locks are
held.  The type system conservatively prohibits this in order to prevent
type-checking loopholes that would result from aliasing and side effects
--- that is, from having two mutable references, of different types, to the
same data. See
Section~\ref{lock-guardedby-invariant-subtyping} for an example
of a problem that would occur if this rule were relaxed.


\paragraph{Polymorphic type qualifiers}

\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardSatisfied}{\small(\emph{index})}
and
\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{PolyGuardedBy}
indicate qualifier polymorphism.  For a description of qualifier
polymorphism, see Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism}.

\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardSatisfied}{\small(\emph{index})}]
  If a variable \<x> has type \code{@GuardSatisfied}, then all
  lock expressions for \<x>'s value are held.

%  \code{@GuardSatisfied} is the default type qualifier for method
%  formal parameters (including the receiver parameter)
%  if the programmer does not
%  write an explicit locking type qualifier.
  \textcolor{red}{JT: The best default for each location will be decided on after performing
  additional experiments.}
  See Section~\ref{lock-checker-polymorphism}
  for an example of a use of \code{@GuardSatisfied}.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{PolyGuardedBy}]
  It is unknown what the guards are or whether they are held.
  An expression whose type is \code{@PolyGuardedBy}
  cannot be dereferenced.

\end{description}

\begin{figure}
\includeimage{lock-guardedby}{3cm}
\caption{The subtyping relationship of the Lock Checker's qualifiers.
\code{@GuardedBy(\{\})} is the default type qualifier for all unannotated
types, except that \code{@GuardSatisfied} is the default for formal parameters.

additional experiments.}
Qualifiers in gray
are used internally by the type system but should never be written by a
programmer.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Declaration annotations\label{lock-declaration-annotations}}

The Lock Checker supports several annotations that specify method behavior.
These are declaration annotations, not type annotations: they apply to the
method itself rather than to some particular type.

\paragraph{Method pre-conditions and post-conditions}

\begin{description}
\item[\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{Holding}\small{(String[] locks)}]
  All the given lock expressions
  are held at the method call site.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{EnsuresLockHeld}\small{(String[] locks)}]
  The given lock
  expressions are
  locked when the method returns.  This is useful for annotating a
  method that acquires a lock such as
  \sunjavadoc{java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html\#lock()}{ReentrantLock.lock()}.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{EnsuresLockHeldIf}\small{(String[] locks, boolean result)}]
  If the annotated method returns the given
  boolean value (true or false), the given lock
  expressions are locked when the method returns.
  This is useful for annotating a
  method that conditionally acquires a lock.
  See Section~\ref{ensureslockheld-examples} for examples.

\end{description}

\paragraph{Side effect specifications}

\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{LockingFree}]
  The method does not acquire or release locks,
  directly or indirectly.  The method is not \<synchronized>, it contains
  no \<synchronized> blocks, it contains no calls to \<lock> or \<unlock>
  methods, and it contains no calls to methods that are not themselves \<@LockingFree>.

  Since
  \code{@SideEffectFree} implies \code{@LockingFree}, if both are applicable
  then you only need to write \code{@SideEffectFree}.

\item[\refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{ReleasesNoLocks}]
  The method does not release any locks that were held prior
  to the method call.  The method might acquire locks but then release
  them, or might acquire locks but not release them (in which case it should
  also be annotated with
  \refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{EnsuresLockHeld} or
  \refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{EnsuresLockHeldIf}).

  This is the default for methods being type-checked that have no \<@LockingFree>,
  \<@MayReleaseLocks>, \code{@SideEffectFree}, or \code{@Pure}
  annotation.

\item[\refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{MayReleaseLocks}]
  It is unknown whether the method releases
  locks that were held prior to the method being called.
  This is the conservative default for methods in unannotated libraries (see \chapterpageref{annotating-libraries}).

\end{description}


\subsection{Type-checking rules}

In addition to the standard subtyping rules enforcing the subtyping relationship
described in Figure~\ref{fig-lock-guardedby-hierarchy}, the Lock Checker enforces
the following additional rules.


\paragraph{Assignments}

\begin{description}

\item[Polymorphic assignments]
  The overall rules for polymorphic qualifiers are given in
  Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism}.  There is an additional constraint
  for assignments whose
  left-hand side is an expression of type
  \<@GuardSatisfied>:  the assignment type-checks only if all locks
  mentioned in the right-hand side's \<@GuardedBy> type are currently held.

\item[\code{@GuardSatisfied}]

  The Lock Checker ensures that for all \<@GuardSatisfied> with the same index, the
  corresponding \code{@GuardedBy} annotations\textcolor{red}{MDE: Arguments have types, but arguments don't have annotations.}
  at the call site all match exactly.\textcolor{red}{I don't understand the
    motivation for this non-standard rule.  Other polymorphic types do not
    place such a constraint on arguments:  the pseudo-assignment has to
    type-check but the types do not have to be identical.  Why should this
    one?}
  Similarly, the Lock Checker ensures that for all \<@GuardSatisfied> with no index, the
  corresponding \code{@GuardedBy} annotations at the call site all match exactly.

\textcolor{red}{MDE:
  Here is a counter-proposal to your specification of @GuardSatisfied
  without an argument.
  Conceptually, @GuardSatisfied must always be written with an argument.
  @GuardSatisfied without an argument means use a fresh (that is, unique) identifier each time.
  (This is different than other @Poly... types, where omitting the
  identifier is shorthand for using the same argument each time, as you
  described.)
Assignments:
  @GuardSatisfied(id) can be freely assigned at its declaration, so long as the right-hand side has all of its guards satisfied
  @GuardSatisfied(id) can only be re-assigned from a right-hand-side of identical @GuardSatisfied(id) type}


  See Section~\ref{lock-checker-polymorphism} for an example demonstrating this rule.

\end{description}

\paragraph{Dereferences}

\begin{description}

\item[\code{@GuardedBy}]
  An expression of type \<@GuardedBy(\emph{eset})> may be dereferenced only
  if all locks in \emph{eset} are held.

\item[\code{@GuardSatisfied}]
  An expression of type \<@GuardSatisfied> may be dereferenced.

\item[Not \code{@GuardedBy} or \code{@GuardSatisfied}]
  An expression whose type is not annotated with \code{@GuardedBy} or
  \code{@GuardSatisfied} may not be dereferenced.
  In particular, an expression of type \code{@PolyGuardedBy} may not be dereferenced.

\end{description}

\paragraph{Primitive types}

Primitive types are treated as being annotated with \<@GuardedBy(\{\})>.
It is an error for the programmer to annotate any primitive type with an annotation from
the \<@GuardedBy> type hierarchy.

%  Primitive values are not guarded.  Instead, the variables that store them are.
%  Therefore, for reads, writes and other operations on primitive values, the Lock Checker requires that
%  the appropriate locks be held, but it does not enforce any other rules.
%  In particular, it does not require the annotations
%  in the types involved in the operation (including assignments and
%  pseudo-assignments) to match.  For example, given:
%  \begin{verbatim}
%  ReentrantLock lock1, lock2;
%  @GuardedBy("lock1") int a;
%  @GuardedBy("lock2") int b;
%  @GuardedBy({}) int c;
%  ...
%  lock1.lock();
%  lock2.lock();
%  a = b;
%  a = c;
%  a = b + c;
%  \end{verbatim}
%  The expressions \code{a = b}, \code{a = c}, and \code{a = b + c}
%  all type check, whereas none of them would type check if \code{a},
%  \code{b} and \code{c} were not primitives.

\paragraph{Overriding}

\begin{description}

\item[Overriding methods annotated with \code{@Holding}]
  If class $B$ overrides method $m$ from class $A$, then the expressions in
  $B$'s \<@Holding>
  annotation must be a subset of or equal to that of $A$.

\item[Overriding methods annotated with side effect annotations]
  If class $B$ overrides method $m$ from class $A$, then
  the side effect annotation on $B$'s declaration of $m$
  must be at least as strong as that in $A$'s declaration of $m$.
  From weakest to strongest, the side effect annotations
  processed by the Lock Checker are:
\begin{verbatim}
  @MayReleaseLocks
  @ReleasesNoLocks
  @LockingFree
  @SideEffectFree
  @Pure
\end{verbatim}

\end{description}

\paragraph{Side effects}

\begin{description}

\item[Releasing explicit locks]
  Any method that releases an explicit lock must be annotated
  with \code{@MayReleaseLocks}.
  The Lock Checker issues a warning if it encounters a method declaration
  annotated with \code{@MayReleaseLocks} and having a formal parameter
  or receiver annotated with \code{@GuardSatisfied}.  This is because
  the Lock Checker cannot guarantee that the guard will be satisfied
  throughout the body of a method if that method may release a lock.

\item[No side effects on lock expressions]
  If expression \emph{expr} is used to acquire a lock, then
  \emph{expr} must evaluate to the same value, starting from when
  \emph{expr} is used to acquire a lock until \emph{expr} is used to
  release the lock.
  An expression is used to acquire a lock if it is the receiver at a
  call site of a \<synchronized> method, is the expression in a
  \<synchronized> block, or is the argument to a \<lock> method.

\item[Locks are released after possible side effects]
% These are standard dataflow analysis rules, but are worth
% repeating here due to how important they are for the day-to-day
% use of the Lock Checker.  I believe this would be the single
% largest source of confusion amongst Lock Checker users if this
% were not stated explicitly.
  After a call to a method annotated with \code{@LockingFree},
  \code{@ReleasesNoLocks}, \code{@SideEffectFree}, or \code{@Pure},
  the Lock Checker's estimate of held locks
  after a method call is the same as that prior to the method call.
  After a call to a method annotated with \code{@MayReleaseLocks},
  the estimate of held locks is conservatively reset to the empty set,
  except for those locks specified to be held after the call
  by an \code{@EnsuresLockHeld} or \code{@EnsuresLockHeldIf}
  annotation on the method.  Assignments to variables also
  cause the estimate of held locks to be conservatively reduced
  to a smaller set if the Checker Framework determines that the
  assignment might have side-effected a lock expression.
  For more information on side effects, please refer to
  Section~\ref{type-refinement-purity}.

\end{description}


\subsection{Polymorphism and handling call sites with different types\label{lock-checker-polymorphism}}

The polymorphic \code{@GuardSatisfied} type annotation allows a method
to be called with different \code{@GuardedBy} annotations on the parameters
and receiver at each call site.

\textcolor{red}{MDE:  This section's title, and the topic sentence, talk
  about handling multiple call sites, but the section never gives an
  example of that.  Therefore, the section seems to ramble and never
  address its topic.  Readers will not be able to follow it.  I think it
  needs to be rewritten.}


Consider the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
ReentrantLock lock1, lock2;
@GuardedBy("lock1") StringBuffer filename;
@GuardedBy("lock2") StringBuffer extension;
...
lock1.lock();
lock2.lock();
filename = filename.append(extension);
\end{verbatim}
% Technically, the 'filename = ' is unnecessary in the example,
% but is helpful to illustrate the type-checking against the
% return value of the call to append.

Consider now the declaration of \sunjavadoc{java/lang/StringBuffer.html\#append-java.lang.String-}{StringBuffer.append(String str)}:

\begin{verbatim}
public StringBuffer append(StringBuffer this, String str)
\end{verbatim}

Clearly the declaration has no notion of any specific locks that the receiver
and the \code{str} parameter might be guarded by, such as \code{lock1} and \code{lock2}.
In order for the example to type check, the declaration needs to be annotated
to indicate that it is safe to provide a receiver and a parameter guarded by
arbitrary sets of locks, provided that those locks are held at the method
call site.

The documentation for \sunjavadoc{java/lang/StringBuffer.html\#append-java.lang.String-}{StringBuffer.append(String str)}
indicates that the method returns the updated receiver.
\code{@GuardSatisfied(1)} is used
to indicate that, although the lock expressions guarding the receiver
are unknown at the method declaration site, it is known that the receiver
parameter and the return value are guarded by the same set of lock expressions.

The parameter \code{str} may also be guarded by an arbitrary set of locks at the call
site.  However, this set of locks is unrelated to the set of locks guarding
the receiver and return value.  Therefore \code{str} is annotated with
\code{@GuardSatisfied(2)}.

It is clear that this method does not make any use of
locks or synchronization.  Therefore it is appropriate to annotate it
with \code{@LockingFree}.

The annotated declaration is:

\begin{verbatim}
@LockingFree
public @GuardSatisfied(1) StringBuffer append(@GuardSatisfied(1) StringBuffer this,
                                              @GuardSatisfied(2) String str)
\end{verbatim}

With these annotations in place, the example type checks.

\section{Examples\label{lock-examples}}

The Lock Checker guarantees that a value that was computed from an expression of \code{@GuardedBy} type is
dereferenced only when the current thread holds all the expressions in the
\code{@GuardedBy} annotation.

\subsection{Examples of @GuardedBy\label{lock-examples-guardedby}}

The following example demonstrates the basic
type-checking rules.

\begin{Verbatim}
class MyClass {
  Object lock; // Initialized in the constructor

  @GuardedBy("lock") Object x = new Object();
  @GuardedBy("lock") Object y = x; // OK, because dereferences of y will require "lock" to be held.
  @GuardedBy({}) Object z = x; // ILLEGAL because dereferences of z do not require "lock" to be held.
  @GuardedBy("lock") Object myMethod(){
     return x; // OK because the return type is annotated with @GuardedBy("lock")
  }

  [...]

  void exampleMethod(){
     x.toString(); // ILLEGAL because the lock is not known to be held
     y.toString(); // ILLEGAL because the lock is not known to be held
     myMethod().toString(); // ILLEGAL because the lock is not known to be held
     synchronized(lock) {
       x.toString();  // OK: the lock is known to be held
       y.toString();  // OK: the lock is known to be held
       myMethod().toString(); // OK: the lock is known to be held
     }
  }
}
\end{Verbatim}

Note that the expression \code{new Object()} is assumed to have type \code{@GuardedBy("lock")}
because it is immediately assigned to a newly-declared
variable having type annotation \code{@GuardedBy("lock")}.  You could
explicitly write \code{new @GuardedBy("lock") Object()} but it is not
required.


\subsection{@GuardedBy(\{``a'', ``b''\}) is not a subtype of @GuardedBy(\{``a''\})\label{lock-guardedby-invariant-subtyping}}


\textbf{@GuardedBy(exprSet)}

The following example demonstrates the reason the Lock Checker enforces the
following rule:  if \emph{exprSet1} $\neq$ \emph{exprSet2}, then
\code{@GuardedBy(\emph{exprSet1})} and \code{@GuardedBy(\emph{exprSet2})} are siblings in the type
hierarchy.

\begin{Verbatim}
class MyClass {
    Object a = new Object();
    Object b = new Object();
    @GuardedBy("a") Object x = new Object();
    @GuardedBy({"a", "b"}) Object y = new Object();
    void myMethod() {
        y = x;
        synchronized(a) {
          x.toString();  // dereferences y's value without holding lock b
        }
    }
}
\end{Verbatim}


If the Lock Checker permitted the assignment
\code{y = x;}, then the undesired dereference would be possible.


\subsection{Examples of @Holding\label{lock-examples-holding}}

The following example shows the interaction between these two annotations:

\begin{Verbatim}
  void helper1(@GuardedBy("myLock") Object a) {
    a.toString(); // ILLEGAL: the lock is not held
    synchronized(myLock) {
      a.toString();  // OK: the lock is held
    }
  }
  @Holding("myLock")
  void helper2(@GuardedBy("myLock") Object b) {
    b.toString(); // OK: the lock is held
  }
  void helper3(@GuardedBy("myLock") Object d) {
    d.toString(); // ILLEGAL: the lock is not held
  }
  void myMethod2(@GuardedBy("myLock") Object e) {
    helper1(e);  // OK to pass to another routine without holding the lock
    e.toString(); // ILLEGAL: the lock is not held
    synchronized (myLock) {
      helper2(e); // OK: the lock is held
      helper3(e); // OK, but helper3's body has an error.
    }
  }
\end{Verbatim}


\subsection{Examples of @EnsuresLockHeld and @EnsuresLockHeldIf\label{ensureslockheld-examples}}

\code{@EnsuresLockHeld} and \code{@EnsuresLockHeldIf} are primarily intended
for annotating JDK locking methods, as in:

\begin{Verbatim}
package java.util.concurrent.locks;

class ReentrantLock {

    @EnsuresLockHeld("this")
    public void lock();

    @EnsuresLockHeldIf (expression="this", result=true)
    public boolean tryLock();

    ...
}
\end{Verbatim}

They can also be used to annotate user methods, particularly for
higher-level lock constructs such as a Monitor, as in this simplified example:

\begin{Verbatim}
public class Monitor {

    private ReentrantLock lock; // Initialized in the constructor

    ...

    @EnsuresLockHeld("lock")
    public void enter() {
       lock.lock();
    }

    ...
}
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Example of @LockingFree\label{lock-lockingfree-example}}

\code{@LockingFree} is useful when a method does not make any use of synchronization
or locks but causes other side effects (hence \code{@SideEffectFree} is not appropriate).
\code{@SideEffectFree} implies \code{@LockingFree}, therefore if both are applicable,
you should only write \code{@SideEffectFree}.


\begin{verbatim}
private Object myField;
private ReentrantLock lock; // Initialized in the constructor
private @GuardedBy("lock") Object x; // Initialized in the constructor

[...]

// This method does not use locks or synchronization but cannot
// be annotated as @SideEffectFree since it alters myField.
@LockingFree
void myMethod() {
    myField = new Object();
}

@SideEffectFree
int mySideEffectFreeMethod() {
    return 0;
}

void myUnlockingMethod() {
    lock.unlock();
}

// could be annotated @LockingFree, but the programme didn't do so
void myUnannotatedMethod() {
}

void myOtherMethod() {
    if (lock.tryLock()) {
        x.toString(); // OK: the lock is held
        myMethod();
        x.toString(); // OK: the lock is still known to be held
        mySideEffectFreeMethod();
        x.toString(); // OK: the lock is still known to be held
        myUnlockingMethod();
        x.toString(); // ILLEGAL: the lock is not known to be held
    }
    if (lock.tryLock()) {
        x.toString(); // OK: the lock is held
        myUnannotatedMethod();
        x.toString(); // ILLEGAL: the lock is not known to be held
                      // (The lock is actually still held, but the Lock
                      // Checker relies on method annotations at call sites.)
    }
}
\end{verbatim}




\section{More locking details\label{lock-details}}

This section gives some details that are helpful for understanding how Java
locking and the Lock Checker works.

\subsection{Two types of locking:  monitor locks and explicit locks\label{lock-two-types}}

Java provides two types of locking:  monitor locks and explicit locks.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A \<synchronized(\emph{E})> block acquires the lock on the value of
  \emph{E}; similarly, a method declared using the \<synchronized> method
  modifier acquires the lock on the method receiver when called.
  (More precisely,
  the current thread locks the monitor associated with the value of
  \emph{E}; see \href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.1}{JLS \S17.1}.)
  The lock is automatically released when execution exits the block or the
  method body, respectively.
  We use the term ``monitor lock'' for a lock acquired using a
  \<synchronized>  block or \<synchronized> method modifier.
\item A method call, such as
  \sunjavadoc{java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html\#lock()}{Lock.lock()},
  acquires a lock that implements the
  \sunjavadoc{java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html}{Lock}
  interface.
  The lock is released by another method call, such as
  \sunjavadoc{java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html\#unlock()}{Lock.unlock()}.
  We use the term ``explicit lock'' for a lock expression acquired in this
  way.
\end{itemize}

You should not mix the two varieties of locking, and the Lock Checker
enforces this.  To prevent an object from being used both as a monitor and
an explicit lock, the Lock Checker issues a warning if a
\<synchronized(\emph{E})> block's expression \<\emph{E}> has a type that
implements \sunjavadoc{java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html}{Lock}.
% The Lock Checker does not keep track of which locks are monitors
% and which are explicit, so this check is necessary for the Lock Checker to
% function correctly, and it also alerts the programmer of a code smell.


\subsection{Held locks and held expressions; aliasing\label{lock-aliasing}}

Whereas Java locking is defined in terms of values, Java programs are
written in terms of expressions.
We say that a lock expression is held if the value to which the expression
currently evaluates is held.

The Lock Checker conservatively estimates the expressions that are held at
each point in a program.
The Lock Checker does not track aliasing
(different expressions that evaluate to the same value); it only considers
the exact expression used to acquire a lock to be held.  After any statement
that might side-effect a held expression or a lock expression, the Lock
Checker conservatively considers the expression to be no longer held.

Section~\ref{java-expressions-as-arguments} explains which Java
expressions the Lock Checker is able to analyze as lock expressions.


The \code{@LockHeld} and \code{@LockPossiblyHeld} type qualifiers are used internally by the Lock Checker
and should never be written by the programmer.
If you
see a warning mentioning \code{@LockHeld} or \code{@LockPossiblyHeld},
please contact the Checker Framework developers as it is likely to
indicate a bug in the Checker Framework.


\subsection{Run-time checks for locking\label{lock-runtime-checks}}

When you perform a run-time check for locking, such as
\<if (explicitLock.isHeldByCurrentThread())\{...\}> or
\<if (Thread.holdsLock(monitorLock))\{...\}>,
then the Lock Checker considers the lock expression to be held
within the scope of the test.  For more details, see
Section~\ref{type-refinement}.
% Note that the java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock interface does not include
% a run-time test, but ReentrantLock does.


\subsection{Discussion of \<@Holding>\label{lock-checker-holding}}

A programmer might choose to use the \code{@Holding} method annotation in
two different ways:  to specify correctness constraints for a synchronization protocol, or to summarize
intended usage.  Both of these approaches are useful, and the Lock Checker
supports both.

\paragraph{Synchronization protocol\label{lock-checker-holding-synchronization-protocol}}

  \code{@Holding} can specify a synchronization protocol that
  is not expressible as locks over the parameters to a method.  For example, a global lock
  or a lock on a different object might need to be held.  By requiring locks to be
  held, you can create protocol primitives without giving up
  the benefits of the annotations and checking of them.

\paragraph{Method summary that simplifies reasoning\label{lock-checker-holding-method-summary}}

  \code{@Holding} can be a method summary that simplifies reasoning.  In
  this case, the \code{@Holding} doesn't necessarily introduce a new
  correctness constraint; the program might be correct even if the lock
  were not already acquired.

  Rather, here \code{@Holding} expresses a fact about execution:  when
  execution reaches this point, the following locks are known to be already held.  This
  fact enables people and tools to reason intra- rather than
  inter-procedurally.

  In Java, it is always legal to re-acquire a lock that is already held,
  and the re-acquisition always works.  Thus, whenever you write

\begin{Verbatim}
  @Holding("myLock")
  void myMethod() {
    ...
  }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
it would be equivalent, from the point of view of which locks are held
during the body, to write

\begin{Verbatim}
  void myMethod() {
    synchronized (myLock) {   // no-op:  re-acquire a lock that is already held
      ...
    }
  }
\end{Verbatim}


It is better to write a \code{@Holding} annotation rather than writing the
extra synchronized block.  Here are reasons:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The annotation documents the fact that the lock is intended to already be
  held;  that is, the method's contract requires that the lock be held when
  the method is called.
\item
  The Lock Checker enforces that the lock is held when the method is
  called, rather than masking a programmer error by silently re-acquiring
  the lock.
\item
  The version with a synchronized statement can deadlock if, due to a programmer error,
  the lock is not already held.  The Lock Checker prevents this type of
  error.
\item
  The annotation has no run-time overhead.  Even if the lock re-acquisition
  succeeds, it still consumes time.
\end{itemize}


\section{Other lock annotations\label{lock-other-annotations}}

The Checker Framework's lock annotations are similar to annotations used
elsewhere.

If your code is already annotated with a different lock
annotation, you can reuse that effort.  The Checker Framework comes with
cleanroom re-implementations of annotations from other tools.  It treats
them exactly as if you had written the corresponding annotation from the
Lock Checker, as described in Figure~\ref{fig-lock-refactoring}.

Alternately, the Checker Framework can process those other annotations (as
well as its own, if they also appear in your program).  The Checker
Framework has its own definition of the annotations on the left side of
Figure~\ref{fig-lock-refactoring}, so that they can be used as type
annotations.  The Checker Framework interprets them according to the right
side of Figure~\ref{fig-lock-refactoring}.


\subsection{Relationship to annotations in \emph{Java Concurrency in Practice}\label{lock-jcip-annotations}}

The book \href{http://jcip.net/}{\emph{Java Concurrency in Practice}}~\cite{Goetz2006} defines a
\href{http://jcip.net.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/annotations/doc/net/jcip/annotations/GuardedBy.html}{\code{@GuardedBy}} annotation that is the inspiration for ours.  The book's
\code{@GuardedBy} serves two related but distinct purposes:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  When applied to a field, it means that the given lock must be held when
  accessing the field.  The lock acquisition and the field access may occur
  arbitrarily far in the future.
\item
  When applied to a method, it means that the given lock must be held by
  the caller at the time that the method is called --- in other words, at
  the time that execution passes the \code{@GuardedBy} annotation.
\end{itemize}

The Lock Checker renames the method annotation to
\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{Holding}, and it generalizes the
\refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardedBy} annotation into a type annotation
that can apply not just to a field but to an arbitrary type (including the
type of a parameter, return value, local variable, generic type parameter,
etc.).  Another important distinction is that the Lock Checker's
annotations express and enforce a locking discipline over values, just like
the JLS expresses Java's locking semantics; by contrast, JCIP's annotations
express a locking discipline that protects variable names and does not
prevent race conditions.
  This makes the annotations more expressive and also more amenable
to automated checking.  It also accommodates the distinct
meanings of the two annotations, and resolves ambiguity when \<@GuardedBy>
is written in a location that might apply to either the method or the
return type.

(The JCIP book gives some rationales for reusing the annotation name for
two purposes.  One rationale is
that there are fewer annotations to learn.  Another rationale is
that both variables and methods are ``members'' that can be ``accessed'';
variables can be accessed by reading or writing them (putfield, getfield),
and methods can be accessed by calling them (invokevirtual,
invokeinterface):  in both cases, \code{@GuardedBy} creates preconditions
for accessing so-annotated members.  This informal intuition is
inappropriate for a tool that requires precise semantics.)

% It would not work to retain the name \code{@GuardedBy} but put it on the
% receiver; an annotation on the receiver indicates what lock must be held
% when it is accessed in the future, not what must have already been held
% when the method was called.


\section{Possible extensions\label{lock-extensions}}

The Lock Checker validates some uses of locks, but not all.  It would be
possible to enrich it with additional annotations.  This would increase the
programmer annotation burden, but would provide additional guarantees.

Lock ordering:  Specify that one lock must be acquired before or after
another, or specify a global ordering for all locks.  This would prevent
deadlock.

Not-holding:  Specify that a method must not be called if any of the listed
locks are held.

These features are supported by
\href{http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html}{Clang's
  thread-safety analysis}.
