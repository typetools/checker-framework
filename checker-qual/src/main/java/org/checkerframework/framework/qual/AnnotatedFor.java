/**
 * Indicates that this class has been annotated for the given type system. For example,
 * {@code @AnnotatedFor({"nullness", "regex"})} indicates that the class has been annotated with
 * annotations such as {@code @Nullable} and {@code @Regex}.
 *
 * <p>You should only use this annotation in a partially-annotated library. There is no point to
 * using it in a fully-annotated library nor in an application that does not export APIs for
 * clients.
 *
 * <p>This annotation has no effect unless the {@code
 * -AuseConservativeDefaultsForUncheckedCode=source} command-line argument is supplied. Ordinarily,
 * the {@code -AuseConservativeDefaultsForUncheckedCode=source} command-line argument causes
 * unannotated locations to be defaulted using conservative defaults, and it suppresses all
 * warnings. However, a class with a relevant {@code @AnnotatedFor} annotation is always defaulted
 * normally (typically using the CLIMB-to-top rule), and typechecking warnings are issued.
