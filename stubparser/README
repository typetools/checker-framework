stubparser
__________

A JSR-308-conforming Java parser with AST generation and visitor support.
The project is based on javaparser (http://javaparser.github.io/javaparser/).

The project branched off of javaparser 1.0.7, available at:
  http://code.google.com/p/javaparser/downloads/list

Known Issues:
- does not parse annotations on new class or new array expressions
- uses the old receiver parameter syntax, must be adapted
- This is only a Java 1.5 parser, ideally we would update to a more recent
  version that supports Java 8.  This is low priority because users are
  encouraged to use annotated libraries rather than stub files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To modify and rebuild the parser, install javacc (the Java Compiler
Compiler, available from http://javacc.java.net/), edit the grammar
in src/japa/parser/java_1_5.jj, and rebuild the parser:
    cd src/java/parser
    javacc java_1_5.jj

When debugging parser changes, the -debug_parser option is helpful.  It
provides extensive debug output about what parses are attempted.
