<h1>Checker Framework developer manual</h1>

<p>
  If you wish to use the Checker Framework, see its user manual
  (<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/">HTML</a>,
  <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/checker-framework-manual.pdf">PDF</a>).
</p>

<p>
This document contains information for Checker Framework developers,
including people who wish to edit its source code or make pull requests.
</p>


<h2>Directory structure</h2>

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework">checker-framework
repository</a> contains several related projects:
</p>

<pre>
 framework     the "framework" aspects of the Checker Framework
 checker       the type checkers provided with the Checker Framework
 javacutil     utilities for javac
 dataflow      a dataflow framework
</pre>

<p>
Each of these directories contains Eclipse project configuration files.
</p>

<p>
The repository also contains the following directories:
</p>
<pre>
 docs          documentation: manual, tutorial, examples, developer docs
 maven-artifacts  artifacts to be uploaded to Maven Central
</pre>


<h2> Gradle build scripts</h2>

<p>
Full instructions for building the Checker Framework from sources appear in the <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#build-source">Checker Framework manual</a>. This section describes the build scripts themselves.
</p>

<p>
Don't run the <code>gradle</code> command, which would use your local installation of gradle.
Instead, use
the <code>gradlew</code> script in the <code>checker-framework</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
Frequently-used tasks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>assemble</code>: builds all jars except <code>jdk8.jar</code>, including javadoc jars and fat jars that contain all dependencies.
  <li> <code>build</code>: <code>assemble</code>, plus runs all JUnit tests.
  <li> <code>buildJdk</code>: builds <code>jdk8.jar</code>.
  <li> <code>allTests</code>: runs all tests.
  <li> <code>reformat</code>: reformats Java files.
  <li> <code>NameOfJUnitTest</code>: runs the JUnit test with that name; for example, <code>NullnessFbcTest</code>.
  <li> <code>task</code>: lists tasks; use <code>--all</code> to see all tasks.
</ul>

<p>
If you run a task from the main directory, then it will run that task in all
subprojects with a task by that name. So, if you run <code>./gradlew
allTests</code> that runs all tests everywhere. But <code>(cd
framework &amp;&amp; ../gradlew allTests)</code> only runs tests in
framework. Alternatively, calling <code>:framework:allTests</code> from the
main directory or any subproject has the same effect.  </p>


<h2>Coding style</h2>

<p>
When editing files in the Checker Framework,
see <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/coding-style.html">Michael
Ernst's coding style guidelines</a>.  You may also wish to
see <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-136091.html#248">Oracle's
Java code conventions</a>.
</p>

<p>
The codebase conforms to a consistent indentation style, which is enforced
by a git pre-commit hook. The pre-commit hook runs <code>./gradlew
checkFormat</code> in the top level directory. <code>./gradlew reformat</code>
will format all files such that <code>./gradlew checkFormat</code> succeeds.
</p>

<p>
We don't use <code>@author</code> Javadoc tags in code files.
Doing so clutters the code, and is misleading once that individual
is no longer maintaining the code.
Authorship (and who has made changes recently) can be obtained from the
version control system.
</p>


<h2>Make commits logically uniform</h2>

<p>
Each commit should address a single issue, rather than a commit addressing
multiple issues such as fixing a bug, adding a feature, and changing
formatting.  Focusing each commit on a single issue makes the commit easier
to understand and review; it also eases diagnosis and (if necessary)
rollback.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, each pull request should address a single issue.
</p>


<h2>Pull requests</h2>

<p>
It is acceptable to commit small, noncontroversial changes directly to
master.  (This policy differs from some projects, which require an issue
tracker issue and a pull request for every change, however minor.)
For any change where you want feedback, or where others might have
useful comments or might disagree, please submit a pull request.  Be
conservative in your judgment; others might consider something
controversial that you do not.
</p>

<p>
Work on a branch if you are going to submit a pull request.
This enables others to make changes directly to your branch when that
is more efficient than leaving comments in a pull request.
</p>

<p>
Try to address pull requests promptly, to avoid stalling others while
waiting for your feedback.  If you have been waiting for more than a week
after the pull request was assigned with no feedback, then ping the
assignee, wait at least another business day, and then go ahead and push
your changes.  It's great if reviewers can give feedback, but if they are
too busy to do so, you should recognize that and move on.
</p>

    Ernst's advice about creating GitHub pull requests</a>.
</p>


<h2>Changelog</h2>

<p>
Don't forget to update the changelog if you make changes that are worthy of
telling developers about.  This makes it much easier for someone to make a
release.
</p>


<h2>Documenting refactoring ideas</h2>

<p>
If you have an idea for a code improvement (such as a refactoring), please
document it.  If it can be described concisely and is low priority,
a TODO comment in the code is more appropriate than an
enhancement request in the issue tracker.  The code comment is more likely
to be noticed by someone working with the code, and it is equally easy to
search for.  Furthermore, it doesn't clutter the issue tracker, which
reduces morale and makes the project appear lower-quality than it actually
is.
</p>


<h2>Version numbers for annotated libraries</h2>

<p>
Annotated libraries should be based on a released version of the upstream
library, not an arbitrary commit in the upstream library's version control
system.
</p>

<p>
When making a new version of an annotated library, between upstream
releases, add ".0.1" to the end of the version number.  For example, we
already uploaded version 6.2 to Maven Central, the next version would be
6.2.0.1.  This accommodates the possibility that the upstream maintainers
release 6.2.1.
</p>
