<h2 id="Directory_structure">Directory structure</h2>

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework">checker-framework
repository</a> contains several related projects:
</p>

<pre>
 framework     the "framework" aspects of the Checker Framework
 checker       the type checkers provided with the Checker Framework
 javacutil     utilities for javac
 dataflow      a dataflow framework
</pre>

<p>
The repository also contains the following directories:
</p>
<pre>
 docs          documentation: manual, tutorial, examples, developer docs
 maven-artifacts  artifacts to be uploaded to Maven Central
</pre>


<h2 id="Gradle_build_scripts">Gradle build scripts</h2>

<p>
Full instructions for building the Checker Framework from sources appear in
the <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#build-source">Checker
Framework manual</a>. This section describes the build system (the Gradle build tasks).
</p>

<p>
Don't run the <code>gradle</code> command, which would use your local
installation of gradle.  Instead, use the <code>gradlew</code> script in
the <code>checker-framework</code> directory, also known as
the <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html">Gradle
wrapper</a>.
</p>

<p>
Frequently-used tasks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>assemble</code>: builds all jars except <code>jdk8.jar</code>, including javadoc jars and fat jars that contain all dependencies.
  <li> <code>build</code>: <code>assemble</code>, plus runs all JUnit tests.
  <li> <code>buildJdk</code>: builds <code>jdk8.jar</code>.
  <li> <code>allTests</code>: runs all tests.
  <li> <code>reformat</code>: reformats Java files.
  <li> <code>NameOfJUnitTest</code>: runs the JUnit test with that name; for example, <code>NullnessFbcTest</code>.
  <li> <code>task</code>: lists tasks; use <code>--all</code> to see all tasks.
</ul>

<p>
If you run a task from the main directory, then it will run that task in all
subprojects with a task by that name. So, if you run <code>./gradlew
allTests</code> that runs all tests everywhere. But <code>(cd
framework &amp;&amp; ../gradlew allTests)</code> only runs tests in
framework. Alternatively, running <code>:framework:allTests</code> from the
main directory or any subproject runs the <code>allTests</code> task only in the <code>framework</code> project.
</p>


<h2 id="Coding_style">Coding style</h2>

<p>
Code in this project follows the
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Google Java Style
  Guide</a> (except 4 spaces are used for indentation),
<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/coding-style.html">Michael
Ernst's coding style guidelines</a>, and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconventions-136091.html#248">Oracle's
Java code conventions</a>.
</p>

<p>
Code formatting is enforced by a Git pre-commit hook.  You
can <a href="https://github.com/google/google-java-format#using-the-formatter">configure
your IDE</a> (Eclipse or IntelliJ) to use that formatting.
</p>
<!-- You could also install settings in your IDE:
https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/Metanome/wiki/Installing-the-google-styleguide-settings-in-intellij-and-eclipse
but that is not what is recommended by the google-java-format documentation. -->

<p>
We don't use <code>@author</code> Javadoc tags in code files.
Doing so clutters the code, and is misleading once that individual
is no longer maintaining the code.
Authorship (and who has made changes recently) can be obtained from the
version control system, such as by running <code>git annotate <em>filename</em></code>.
</p>



<h2 id="IDE_configuration">IDE configuration</h2>

<h3 id="Configure_Eclipse_to_edit_the_Checker_Framework">Configure Eclipse to edit the Checker Framework</h3>

<p>
These instructions are relevant if you use Eclipse as your IDE.
</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="../manual/manual.html">Clone and build all projects from their sources.</a>
</li>
<li> Download Eclipse from
the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">official Eclipse website</a>
and install it.
</li>
<li> Run Eclipse.
</li>
<li> Enter the main Eclipse working screen and in the &ldquo;File&rdquo; menu,
select &ldquo;Import&rdquo; &rArr; &ldquo;General&rdquo; &rArr; &ldquo;Existing
Projects into Workspace&rdquo;.
</li>
<li> After the &ldquo;Import Projects&rdquo; window appears, select &ldquo;Select
Root Directory&rdquo;, and select the parent of the <code>$CHECKERFRAMEWORK</code> directory.
</li>
<li> Ensure &ldquo;Search for nested projects&rdquo; is selected in the Options panel.
</li>
<li> Select all the projects in the folder except for &ldquo;personalblog-demo&rdquo;,
then select &ldquo;Finish&rdquo; to import the projects.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Eclipse should successfully build all the imported projects.
If Eclipse reports any errors, ensure you followed the instructions for
<a href="../manual/manual.html">cloning and building all projects.</a>
</p>


<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull requests</h2>

<p>
Each pull request should address a single concern, rather than (say)
addressing multiple concerns such as fixing a bug, adding a feature, and
changing formatting.  Focusing each pull request on a single concern makes
the commit easier to understand and review.  It also makes the commit
history (after the pull request is merged) easier to understand and (if
necessary) revert.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to update the changelog if you make changes that are worthy of
telling developers about.  This makes it much easier for someone to make a
release.
</p>

<p>
Work on a branch if you are going to submit a pull request.
This enables others to make changes directly to your branch when that
is more efficient than leaving comments in a pull request.
</p>

<p>
Also
see <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/github-pull-request.html">Michael
    Ernst's advice about creating GitHub pull requests</a>.
</p>

<p>
When there are related changes in the <code>checker-framework</code>
and <code>checker-framework-inference</code> repositories, use the same
branch name for each.  The continuous integration framework uses a branch
of the same name when possible.  If you use different branch names
in <code>checker-framework</code>
and <code>checker-framework-inference</code>, then the continuous
integration tests for both will fail and may mask problems.
</p>


<h3 id="pull-requests-maintainers">Pull request and commit notes for maintainers</h3>

<p>
It is acceptable to commit small, noncontroversial changes directly to
master.  (This policy differs from some projects, which require an issue
tracker issue and a pull request for every change, however minor.)
As with pull requests, each commit should address a single concern.
For any change where you want feedback, or where others might have
useful comments or might disagree, please submit a pull request.  Be
conservative in your judgment; others might consider something
controversial that you do not.
</p>

<p>
Try to review pull requests promptly, to avoid stalling others while
waiting for your feedback.  If you have been waiting for more than a week
after the pull request was assigned with no feedback, then ping the
assignee, wait at least another business day, and then go ahead and push
your changes.  It's great if reviewers can give feedback, but if they are
too busy to do so, you should recognize that and move on.
</p>


<h2 id="Documenting_refactoring_ideas">Documenting refactoring ideas</h2>

<p>
If you have an idea for a code improvement (such as a refactoring), please
document it.  If it can be described concisely and is low priority, a TODO
comment in the code is more appropriate than an enhancement request in the
issue tracker.  The code comment is more likely to be noticed by someone
working with the code, and it is equally easy to search for.  Furthermore,
it doesn't clutter the issue tracker.  Clutter in the issue tracker reduces
morale, makes it harder to search, and makes the project appear
lower-quality than it actually is.
</p>


<h2 id="annotated-library-version-numbers">Version numbers for annotated libraries</h2>

<p>
  We maintain annotated versions of some third-party libraries.  The source
  code appears in a fork in
  the <a href="https://github.com/typetools">GitHub <code>typetools</code>
  organization</a>.  Binaries are hosted
  at <a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=annotatedlib">Maven Central
  in the <code>org.checkerframework.annotatedlib</code> group</a>.
</p>

<p>
Annotated libraries should be based on a released version of the upstream
library, not an arbitrary commit in the upstream library's version control
system.
</p>

<p>
When making a new version of an annotated library, between upstream
releases, add ".0.1" to the end of the version number.  For example, if we
already uploaded version 6.2 to Maven Central, the next version would be
6.2.0.1.  This accommodates the possibility that the upstream maintainers
release 6.2.1.
</p>
