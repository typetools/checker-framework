  This document explains how to make a release of the Checker Framework
  and the Annotation File Utilities.
The process takes around 2 hours (including manual steps) when all goes according to plan.
  However, the lengthiest steps are automatic so you will be able to work on other tasks.

<h2 id="step_by_step">Step by Step</h2>

<p>
  More information about the steps is
  provided in the code comments of the <code>main()</code> functions of the <code>release_build</code>
  and <code>release_push</code> scripts. Please read those comments if you have never done so before.
</p>

<p>
Answering 'no' to a prompt does not exit the script unless otherwise indicated.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to carefully read all instructions on the command-line before answering 'yes' to a prompt.
This is because the scripts do not ask you to say 'yes' after each step, so you may
miss a step if you only read the paragraph asking you to say 'yes'.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you have never made a release before, follow the instructions in the
    <a href="#pre_release_checklist">Pre-release Checklist</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Update stubparser.</b> If there has been
    a <a href="https://github.com/javaparser/javaparser/releases">JavaParser
    release</a> since the last Checker Framework
    release, <a href="https://github.com/typetools/stubparser#updating-from-upstream-javaparser">update
    Stubparser from JavaParser</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Rebuild jdk8.jar</b> and upload it to https://github.com/typetools/annotated-libraries.
    See <a href="https://github.com/typetools/annotated-libraries/blob/master/README.md">the README</a> for instructions.
    Check that all tests pass (when using the <code>typetools/master</code> branch).
  </li>
  <li>Update the Checker Framework source code:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Update the list of contributors</b> by running
	<code>make contributors.tex</code>
	in <code>checker-framework/docs/manual/</code>.  Double-check the edits
	with <code>git diff</code>; update the <code>plume-scripts/git-authors.sed</code> script if
	any customizations are necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Update AFU and Checker Framework change logs</b> by following the instructions
	at <a href="#content_guidelines">content guidelines</a>.
      </li>
      <li> <b>Update the Checker Framework version number</b>
	in <code>checker-framework/build.gradle</code>,
	in the <code>allprojects</code> block.
	(The AFU version is updated as part of the release scripts.)

	<p>
	Update the minor version if there are any incompatibilities with the previous version.
	This includes incompatibilities for people who are maintaining a checker,
	which happens if the signature changes for any method in these classes:
	</p>
<!-- Add other classes to this list if relevant. -->

        <p>
        (TODO: Write a command that diffs these classes between the previous and current release.)
	</p>
        <p>
	A rule of thumb is that any framework change that requires changes to more than one typechecker should be at least a minor version bump.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Commit and push</b> these changes to typetools/master.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <li>
      <strong>Log into Buffalo</strong><br/>
      <code>ssh $USER@buffalo.cs.washington.edu<br/></code>
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>In a user-specific temporary directory, clone/update the Checker Framework repository (it contains the release scripts).</strong><br/>
      <code>mkdir -p /scratch/$USER/jsr308-release<br/></code>
      <code>cd /scratch/$USER/jsr308-release<br/></code>
      <code>test -d checker-framework && (cd checker-framework && git pull --quiet) || git clone --quiet https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework.git<br/></code>
      <code>cd checker-framework/docs/developer/release<br/></code>
    (The release scripts will checkout and build all dependencies.)
  </li>
  <li><strong>Run release_build</strong> to create the release artifacts and place them in the development website<br/>
      <code>python release_build.py all</code><br/><br/>
      [TODO: Add <code>--auto</code> here, or not?]<br/>
      For verbose debugging output, use the <code>--debug</code> option.<br/><br/>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;all&quot; argument specifies that all projects should be built.
      There has been some work done in order to select only specific projects (AFU and Checker Framework)
      to be built but more work still needs to be done.  Just pass &quot;all&quot; for now.
      See also <a href="#future_continuous_integration">Release in Continuous Integration</a> for more information
      on the option &quot;--auto&quot;, which you can omit in order to
      be asked more questions during the build.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Run release_push</strong> to move release artifacts from the development website to the live site and to Maven Central <br/>
      <code>python release_push.py release</code><br/><br/>
      For minimal prompting, use the <code>--auto</code> option.<br/><br/>
      <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;<strong>release</strong>&quot; argument states that you intend
        to do an actual release.  If you just want to test the script, leave out &quot;release&quot;
        and the script will run but not update anything.
      </div>

      If you get an obscure error about permissions, try running the release_push script several times
      in a row. This will sometimes update the repository permissions such that the script can proceed
      further each time.
  </li>

    latest this should be done before "code freeze".  Before releasing, the person performing
    the release will be asked to verify the changelogs.  Please check that
    there aren't typos (i.e. missing release date/version information, spelling errors, etc...).
    Also check that the changelog obeys the guidelines below.
  </p>

    <h3 id="content_guidelines">Content Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only (and all) changes that affect users go into the changelog.
        If a change is breaking, no matter how small, mention it.</li>
      <li>
            Even if some code has been committed to the repository, don't
            announce the feature until it has been documented in the manual.
      </li>
      <li>Checker Framework:
	<ul>
	  <li>List all issues (in issue trackers) resolved since the previous release:
            <a href="https://checkerframework.org/changelog.txt">previous release</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc">issues query</a>,

          <li>
            Ensure the changelogs reflect version control commits since the last release, via the
	    command line:<br/>
            <code>cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && git log --name-status `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`..</code><br/>
	    or via <a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/commits/master">GitHub Checker Framework commit logs</a>.
	  </li>
          <li>
            Ensure the changelogs reflect changes to the manual since the last release, via the

	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="style_guidelines">Style Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Changes are written from the user's perspective.  Don't include implementation details that users
        don't care about.
      </li>
      <li>To be consistent, write in the past tense (e.g. &quot;Added option for verbose error messages&quot;).</li>
      <li>Lines should not exceed 80 characters wide.</li>
      <li>Break the different programs into their own sections.  See notes on release 1.7.0 and 1.5.0 for an
        example.  Tools should have their own section within the
        Checker Framework release notes (excluding issue fixes from the issue tracker).
      </li>
      <li>Be specific.  Don't write something like "added a few options to Eclipse plugin".  Do write "added
        options to the Eclipse plugin to include stub files, ignore warnings, and show verbose output."
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="backing_out">Backing Out an Uncommitted Release</h2>
  <p>At the time of this writing, there are 2 steps that cannot be reverted.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The push from the interm repositories to the GitHub/Bitbucket (release) repositories</li>
    <li>The release of the staged Maven artifacts</li>
  </ol>
  <p> If you have executed either of these steps and then realized there is a breaking error, you should do another
    release.  The release script will allow you to do a point release like &quot;1.8.0.1&quot; when a version
    &quot;1.8.0&quot; already exists.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you have NOT committed an irreversible step then you can
    follow the steps below to point the live release to a previous release.  You can then redo the original
    release.  Make sure to say &quot;yes&quot; when the release script asks you to delete the old directories.
  </p>
  <h3 id="backing_out_steps">Manual Steps to Back Out a Release</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Drop the artifacts from Central</strong><br/>
      You may have staged and then closed the artifacts in the Sonatypes Central repository.  Drop (do NOT release)
      these artifacts.  See
      <a href="https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-DroppingaStagingRepository%28i.e.WhattoDoifYourStagingRepositoryHasErrors%29">
        the Sonatypes OSS Repository Usage Guidelines.
      </a>
    </li>
    <!-- <li><strong>Drop the Maven Artifacts from our Maven repo *** currently unneeded ***</strong>
      <p class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Note:</strong> The procedure below is NOT recommended
        by the Maven developers guide.  However, if done carefully and quickly no harm will likely
        come.  If people end up with out-of-date artifacts, recommend to them that they use the -U option
        in Maven 3.  Never follow these instructions if the plugin release has been publicized or
        existed for a while.
      </p>

      At the moment, we have decided to drop the user of our local Maven repository in favor of using
      the Central repository exclusively.  This may not be the case in the future.  If we do have a
      local repository, you need to go into the repositories directory (usually an m2-repo directory) and
      manually delete the versions of the Maven artifacts.  For instance, for the artifacts checker and compiler
      using version 0.9.8, I would delete the directories:
      <ul>
        <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/checker/0.9.8</li>
        <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/compiler/0.9.8</li>
      </ul>
      Furthermore, I would grep the files in the parents of these directories and ensure the version number
      does not appear in any metadata.  If so, fix up the metadata.
    </li> -->
  </ul>

  <p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Note:</strong> You may find yourself copying release directories for some
    reason or other.  It is important to remember that the symlinks may be absolute.  You should check any
    symlinks that may be affected by the move and ensure they point to the new location and not the old one.
  </p>

  <h2 id="future_improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
  <p>Below is a roughly priority-ordered list of future improvements.  In a perfect world we would do
    all of these.  At the moment, I believe only the first 2 (Open JDK Javadoc Fixes,
    and More Sanity Checks) should have any appreciable priority.
  </p>

    <h3 id="future_more_sanity_checks">More Sanity Checks</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    There are likely more sanity checks we might want to run during the release process.  One such example
    would be running the tutorial from the command line.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Implement one of the sanity checks mentioned in this section.</li>
      <li>Add your sanity check to the appropriate location in the release_push script.</li>
      <li>Update this document to reflect the new steps.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="sanity-checks">Sanity Checks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Run tutorial sanity check automatically via command line.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="future_continuous_integration">Release in Continuous Integration</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    If we could run the release_build script nightly, we could head off broken links and other
    release related errors.  There is an &quot;--auto&quot; option for this specific reason but a number of
    errors start happening when we run the script from Buffalo.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Create a Buffalo task to run the release_buld script using the &quot;--auto&quot; option.</li>
      <li>Observe the output of this task and identify possible errors.</li>
      <li>Fix up all observed errors until the release_build script runs without error.</li>
      <li>We probably want to move the link checking of the development site to the release_build script and
        write it out to disk.  This will allow the developer releasing the framework to consult pre-made
        link-checking results rather than waiting for the link checker to execute in the push script.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="future_auto-copy_release_scripts">Auto-copy Release Scripts</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    The first step in running the release process, after the pre-release checklist, is to copy the
    release scripts into the <code>jsr308-release</code> directory.  We could automate this.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Create a read-only script in jsr308-release/scripts.</li>
      <li>Edit the script so that it downloads all release scripts into the jsr308-release directory.</li>
      <li>Update this document to reflect this new process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="future_option_parsing">Option Parsing</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    There is currently some primitive option parsing written into the release scripts.  We should use
    Python's built-in option parsing library.  There are multiple built-in libraries.  Please use the latest one.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Look up the latest Python parsing library.</li>
      <li>Replace the option parsing in the release_build.py and release_push.py scripts with library calls.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="future_option_projects">Optional Projects</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    A user might want to test the release_build script only on a specific project.  Some work has gone into
    the ability to select a project to build.  However, this currently doesn't take into consideration of dependencies.
    It might be more hassle than it's worth to implement this feature.  We should either complete the implementation
    or remove the partial implementation that already exists.  See <a href="#future_repl_mode">REPL Mode</a>.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Improve option parsing to allow the user to select only certain projects to build.</li>
      <li>Improve scripts to resolve dependencies between projects and only build the selected projects and
        their dependencies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="future_repl_mode">REPL Mode</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    The current script is built in an imperative style with little use of object orientation.  This improvement
    would create methods or objects that further encapsulate the current set of steps.  We could then provide
    an easy way to execute these steps from the Python REPL.  This would allow the user to execute individual steps
    in whatever order they saw fit from the Python REPL.  This could also be used to
    automatically back out the current release or the ability to edit/debug the release steps more easily.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Further separate the steps of the release process.</li>
      <li>Provide a default parameterization for these steps to make them easily runnable from the
        command line. </li>
      <li>Provide a script to launch Python with these commands on its path.</li>
      <li>Update this README to document the new functionality.</li>
    </ul>
