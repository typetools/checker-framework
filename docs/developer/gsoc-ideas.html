<h1>How to apply to GSoC</h1>

<p>
(Here is a link to <a href="new-contributor-projects.html">the project list</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Each year, the Checker Framework developers work with a small number of Google
Summer of Code students who are paid to contribute to the Checker Framework.
This document gives advice to make your application the best it can be.  We look
forward to your application!
</p>

<h2>The parts of your application</h2>

<p>
  To apply, you will submit a <b>single PDF</b> through the
  <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code
  website</a>.  This PDF should contain two main parts.  We suggest that you
  number the parts and subparts to ensure that you don't forget anything, and to
  ensure that we don't overlook anything when reading your application.  You
  might find it easiest to create multiple PDFs for the different parts, then
  concatenate them before uploading to the website, but how you create your
  proposal is entirely up to you.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <b>proposal</b> itself:  what project you want to work on.  You might propose
    to do a project listed on
    the <a href="new-contributor-projects.html">"projects for new
    contributors"</a> webpage, or you might propose a different project.

    <p>The proposal should have a descriptive title, both in the PDF and in
      the GSoC submission system.  Don't use a title like "Checker
      Proposal" or "Proposal for GSoC".  Don't distract from content with
      gratuitous graphics.
    </p>

    <p>List the tasks or subparts that are required to complete your
    project.  This may help you discover a part that you had forgotten.
    We do not require a detailed timeline, because you don't yet
    know enough to create one.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you want to do a
    case study, say what program you will do your case study on.
    </p>

    <p>If you want to create a new type system (whether one proposed on
    this webpage or one of your own devising), then your proposal should include
    the type system's user manual.  You don't have to integrate it in the Checker
    Framework repository (in other words, use any word processor or text
    editor you want to create a PDF file you will submit), but you should describe
    your proposed checker's <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#creating-parts-of-a-checker">parts</a>
    in precise English or simple formalisms, and you should follow the
    suggested <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#creating-documenting-a-checker">structure</a>.
      <br>
      <b>Warning</b>:
      For GSoC students, the best projects are typically <em>not</em> in
      the <a href="new-contributor-projects.html#create-new-type-system">"Create
      a new type system"</a> category.  The reason is that creating a new type
      system usually takes more time than one summer.  It is better to succeed
      with a smaller task than to fail with a larger task.  If you finish a
      smaller task quickly, then you can proceed to a more ambitious goal.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you want to do exactly a project listed on
    the <a href="new-contributor-projects.html">"projects for new
    contributors"</a> webpage, then just say that (but be specific about which
    one!), and the lack of further details will not hurt your chances of being
    selected.  However, it can be helpful to show that you have thought about
    the problem, by adding details, discussing implementation strategies, or
    giving specific ideas about evaluation or extensions.
    </p>

    <p>Never literally cut-and-paste text that was not written by you without
    attribution, because that would be plagiarism.  If you quote from text
    written by someone else, give proper credit.  Don't submit a proposal that
    is just a rearrangement of text written by other people (for example, from
    the <a href="new-contributor-projects.html">project ideas webpage</a> or the
    Checker Framework manual), because that does not help us assess your
    likelihood of being successful.
    </p>

  </li>

  <li>Your <b>qualifications</b>.  Please convince us that you
    are likely to be successful in your proposed project.

    <ol>
      <li>A URL that points to a code sample.
        Don't write any new code, but provide code you wrote in the
        past, such as for a class assignment
        or a project you have worked on outside class.
        It does not need to have anything to do with
        the Checker Framework project.  It should be your own personal work.
        The code sample helps us assess your programming skills so we can assign you
        to an appropriate project.
        A common problem is submitting undocumented code; we expect every
        programmer to write documentation when working on the Checker
        Framework.
        Don't share a Google Drive folder containing multiple files; rather,
        provide a single <code>.zip</code> file or a GitHub URL.
        (The GitHub URL would be part of your single PDF document;
        a <code>.zip</code> file is allowed to be a separate upload.)
      </li>
      <li>
        What you have done to prepare yourself
        for working with the Checker Framework during the summer.
        You may wish to structure this as a list.
    Examples of items in the list could include:
    <ul>
      <li>Code you have annotated as a case study.  Please indicate the original
        unannotated code (as a URL or a <code>.zip</code> file), the annotated code
        (as a URL or a <code>.zip</code> file), and the exact command to run the
        type-checker from the command line.  Ensure that the GSoC mentors can
        compile your code.  (It is acceptable to use the same code, or different
        code, for this item and the code sample above.)

        <p>
        You should have shared the case study as soon as you finished it or
        as soon as you had a question that is not answered in
        the <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/">manual</a>;
        don't wait until you submit your proposal, because that does not
        give us a chance to help you with feedback.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>URLs for bugs or pull requests that you have filed.  These can be
      related to any project, not only the Checker Framework.</li>
      <li>Information about other projects you have done, or classes you
        have taken, that prepare you for your proposed summer task.  This
        is optional.  If something already appears in your resume, don't
        repeat it here; we will see it in your resume.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <b>resume</b>.
    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9">resume</a>
    contains a brief description of your skills and your job or project
    experience.  It will often list classes you have taken so far and your
    GPA.  It should not be longer than one page.</li>
  <li>An unofficial <b>transcript</b> or grade report (don't spend
    money for an official one), if you are a student.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Advice</h2>

<p>
The <b>best way</b> to impress us is by doing a thoughtful job in the <b>case
study</b>.  The case study is even more important than the proposal text,
because it shows us your abilities.
The case study may result in you submitting issues against the issue tracker of the
program you are annotating or of the Checker Framework.
Pull requests against the Checker Framework GitHub project are a plus but are not required:
good submitted bugs are just as valuable as bug fixes!
You can also make a good impression by correctly answering questions from
other students on the GSoC mailing list.
</p>

<p>
Some GSoC organizations have a requirement to fix an issue in the issue tracker
or open a pull request.  The Checker Framework does not have that requirement.
For us, a pull request is a plus, but it is <em>not</em> necessary.  It can be
unproductive to try to fix an issue before you understand the Checker Framework
from the user point of view.  Understanding the Checker Framework requires using
it, for example by doing a case study on an open-source program.
</p>

<h3>Get feedback</h3>

<p>
  We want your application to be competitive, and we want you to succeed.  We
  encourage you to ask us for feedback and other help.  Historically, students
  who start early and get feedback are most successful.
</p>

<p>
  For discussions related to GSoC, please send mail to
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/checker-framework-gsoc">checker-framework-gsoc@googlegroups.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please do not violate the guidelines
in <a href="new-contributor-projects.html#ask-questions">How to get help and ask
questions</a>.  If you violate them, you are disqualified from participating in
GSoC, because it shows that you do not read instructions, and you haven't
thought about the problem nor tried to solve it.
</p>

<p>
You can submit a draft proposal via the Google Summer of Code website, and we
will review it.  We do <em>not</em> receive any notification when you submit a
draft proposal, so if you want feedback, please tell us that.  Also, we can only
see draft proposals. If you submit a final proposal, we cannot see it until
after the application deadline has passed.
