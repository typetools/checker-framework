# Similar to ../logo/add-favicon, but works only on a single file: manual.html
# The reason we don't just fix ../logo/add-favicon to work on a single file instead
# of creating this special-purpose script is that any changes we make to ../logo/add-favicon
# would promptly be overwritten the next time it is updated from the plume-lib repository.
# Likewise any changes made to add-favicon in the plume-lib repository would be overwritten
# once we refreshed it from its original source.
