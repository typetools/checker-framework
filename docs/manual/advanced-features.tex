\chapterAndLabel{Advanced type system features}{advanced-type-system-features}

This chapter describes features that are automatically supported by every
checker written with the Checker Framework.
You may wish to skim or skip this chapter on first reading.  After you have
used a checker for a little while and want to be able to express more
sophisticated and useful types, or to understand more about how the Checker
Framework works, you can return to it.


\sectionAndLabel{Invariant array types}{invariant-arrays}

Java's type system is unsound with respect to arrays.  That is, the Java
type-checker approves code that is unsafe and will cause a run-time crash.
Technically, the problem is that Java has ``covariant array types'', such
as treating \<String[]> as a subtype of \<Object[]>.  Consider the
following example:

\begin{Verbatim}
  String[] strings = new String[] {"hello"};
  Object[] objects = strings;
  objects[0] = new Object();
  String myString = strs[0];
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The above code puts an \<Object> in the array \<strings> and thence in
\<myString>, even though \<myString = new Object()> should be, and is,
rejected by the Java type system.  Java prevents corruption of the JVM by
doing a costly run-time check at every array assignment; nonetheless, it is
undesirable to learn about a type error only via a run-time crash rather
than at compile time.

When you pass the \<-AinvariantArrays> command-line option,
the Checker Framework is stricter than Java, in the sense that it treats
arrays invariantly rather than covariantly.  This means that a type system
built upon the Checker Framework is sound:  you get a compile-time
guarantee without the need for any run-time checks.  But it also means that
the Checker Framework rejects code that is similar to what Java unsoundly
accepts.  The guarantee and the compile-time checks are about your
extended type system.  The Checker Framework does not reject the example
code above, which contains no type annotations.

Java's covariant array typing is sound if the array is used in a read-only
fashion:  that is, if the array's elements are accessed but the array is
not modified.  However, facts about read-only usage are not built into any of
the type-checkers.  Therefore, when using type systems
along with \<-AinvariantArrays>, you will need to suppress any warnings that
are false positives because the array is treated in a read-only way.


\sectionAndLabel{Context-sensitive type inference for array constructors}{array-context-sensitive}

When you write an expression, the Checker Framework gives it the most
precise possible type, depending on the particular expression or value.
For example, when using the Regex Checker (\chapterpageref{regex-checker}),
the string \<"hello"> is given type \<@Regex String> because it is a legal
regular expression (whether it is meant to be used as one or not) and the
string \<"(foo"> is given the type \<@RegexBottom String> because it is not
a legal regular expression.

Array constructors work differently.  When you create an array with the
array constructor syntax, such as the right-hand side of this assignment:

\begin{Verbatim}
String[] myStrings = {"hello"};
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
then the expression does not get the most precise possible type, because
doing so could cause inconvenience.  Rather, its type is determined by the
context in which it is used:  the left-hand side if it is in an assignment,
the declared formal parameter type if it is in a method call, etc.

In particular, if the expression \verb|{"hello"}| were given the type
\<@Regex String[]>, then the assignment would be illegal!  But the Checker
Framework gives the type \<String[]> based on the assignment context, so the code
type-checks.

If you prefer a specific type for a constructed array, you can indicate
that either in the context (change the declaration of \<myStrings>) or in a
\<new> construct (change the expression to \<new @Regex String[] >\verb|{"hello"}|).


\sectionAndLabel{The effective qualifier on a type (defaults and inference)}{effective-qualifier}

A checker sometimes treats a type as having a slightly different qualifier
than what is written on the type --- especially if the programmer wrote no
qualifier at all.
Most readers can skip this section on first reading, because you will
probably find the system simply ``does what you mean'', without forcing
you to write too many qualifiers in your program.
In particular, qualifiers in method bodies are rare (except occasionally on
type arguments).

Most of this section is about defaults for source code that is read by
the compiler.  When the compiler reads a \<.class> file, different
defaulting rules apply.
See Section~\ref{defaults-classfile} for these rules.

The following steps determine the effective
qualifier on a type --- the qualifier that the checkers treat as being present.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  If a type qualifier is present in the source code, that qualifier is used.

  If the type would have an implicit qualifier (step 2, immediately below),
  then it is an error to write an
  explicit qualifier that is equal to (redundant with) or a supertype of
  (weaker than) the implicit qualifier.  A programmer may strengthen
  (write a subtype of) an implicit qualifier, however.

\item
  If there is no explicit type qualifier,
  the type system adds implicit qualifiers.

  Implicit qualifiers arise from two sources:
\begin{description}
\item[built-in]
  Implicit qualifiers can be
  built into a type system (Section~\ref{creating-type-introduction}), in
  which case the type system's documentation explains all of the type
  system's implicit qualifiers.

  Here are some examples of built-in implicit qualifiers:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the Nullness type system (see \chapterpageref{nullness-checker}),
  \<enum> values, string literals, and method receivers are always non-null.
\item
  In the Interning type system (see \chapterpageref{interning-checker}),
  string literals and \<enum> values are always interned.
\end{itemize}

\item[programmer-declared]
  A programmer may introduce an implicit annotation on each use of class
  $C$ by writing a qualifier on the declaration of class $C$.  If \<MyClass>
  is declared as \<class @MyAnno MyClass \ttlcb...\ttrcb>, then each
  unqualified occurrence of
  \<MyClass> in the source code is treated as if it were \<@MyAnno
  MyClass>.

  A programmer may introduce an implicit annotation on each invocation of a
  constructor
  by writing a qualifier on the declaration of the constructor.  Given
  declaration \<@MyAnno MyClass(int arg) \ttlcb...\ttrcb>, then each
  unqualified occurrence of
  \<new MyClass(myInt)> in the source code is treated as if it were \<new @MyAnno
  MyClass(myInt)>.
\end{description}



\item
  If there is no explicit or implicit qualifier on a type, then a default
  qualifier
  % except for type parameters, but don't clutter this text with that detail
  is applied; see Section~\ref{defaults}.

%BEGIN LATEX
  % This looks bad in HTML.
  \smallskip
%END LATEX

  At this point (after step 3), every type has a qualifier.

\item
  The type system may refine a qualified type on a local variable --- that
  is, treat it as a subtype of how it was declared or defaulted.  This
  refinement is always sound and has the effect of eliminating false
  positive error messages.  See Section~\ref{type-refinement}.

  % Type
  % qualifier refinement is implemented by the \refclass{framework/flow}{Flow} class.

\end{enumerate}



\subsectionAndLabel{Default qualifier for unannotated types}{defaults}

An unannotated
Java type is treated as if it had a default annotation.
A type system designer, or an end-user programmer, can control the defaulting.
Defaulting never applies to uses of type variables, even if they do not
have an explicit type annotation.

There are several defaulting mechanisms, for convenience and flexibility.
When determining the default qualifier for a use of a type, the following
rules are used in order, until one applies.
(Some of these currently do not work in stub files.)
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use the innermost user-written \code{@DefaultQualifier}, as explained in
  this section.
\item
  Use the default specified by the type system designer
  (Section~\ref{creating-typesystem-defaults});
  this is usually CLIMB-to-top (Section~\ref{climb-to-top}).
\item
  When using the Subtyping Checker,
  use \refqualclass{common/subtyping/qual}{Unqualified}
  as default, if it is a supported qualifier and nothing else is specified by the
  type system designer.
  This makes initial experiments with the Subtyping Checker convenient.
\end{itemize}

% (Implementation detail:  setting defaults is implemented by the
% \refclass{framework/util}{QualifierDefaults} class.)


The end-user programmer specifies a default qualifier by writing the
\refqualclass{framework/qual}{DefaultQualifier}\code{(\emph{ClassName}, }[\emph{locations}]\<)>
annotation on a package, class, method, or variable declaration.  The
argument to \refqualclass{framework/qual}{DefaultQualifier} is the \code{Class}
name of an annotation.
The optional second argument indicates where the default
applies.  If the second argument is omitted, the specified annotation is
the default in all locations.  See the Javadoc of \refclass{framework/qual}{DefaultQualifier} for details.

For example, using the Nullness type system (Chapter~\ref{nullness-checker}):

\begin{Verbatim}
import org.checkerframework.framework.qual.DefaultQualifier;
import org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual.NonNull;

@DefaultQualifier(NonNull.class)
class MyClass {

  public boolean compile(File myFile) { // myFile has type "@NonNull File"
    if (!myFile.exists())          // no warning: myFile is non-null
      ...
    @Nullable File srcPath = ...;  // must annotate to specify "@Nullable File"
    if (srcPath.exists())          // warning: srcPath might be null
      ...
  }

  @DefaultQualifier(Tainted.class)
  public boolean isJavaFile(File myfile) {  // myFile has type "@Tainted File"
    ...
  }
}
\end{Verbatim}

You may write multiple
\refqualclass{framework/qual}{DefaultQualifier} annotations at a single location.

If \code{@DefaultQualifier}[\code{s}] is placed on a package (via the
\<package-info.java> file), then it applies to the given package \emph{and}
all subpackages.
% This is slightly at odds with Java's treatment of packages of different
% names as essentially unrelated, but is more intuitive and useful.

Recall that an annotation on a class definition indicates an implicit
qualifier (Section~\ref{effective-qualifier}) that can only be
strengthened, not weakened.  This can lead to unexpected results if
the default qualifier applies to a class definition.  Thus, you may want to
put explicit qualifiers on class declarations (which prevents the default
from taking effect), or exclude class declarations from defaulting.


%% Don't even bother to bring this up; it will just sow confusion without
%% being helpful.
% For some type systems, a user may not specify a default qualifier, or doing
% so prevents giving any other qualifier to any reference.  This is a
% consequence of the design of the type system; see
% Section~\ref{bottom-and-top-qualifier}.


When a programmer omits an \<extends> clause at a declaration of a type
parameter, the implicit upper bound is defaulted to the top qualifier; see
Section~\ref{climb-to-top}.


\subsectionAndLabel{Defaulting rules and CLIMB-to-top}{climb-to-top}

Each type system defines a default qualifier (see
Section~\ref{creating-typesystem-defaults}).  For example, the default
qualifier for the Nullness Checker is
\refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{NonNull}.  When a user
writes an unqualified type such as \<Date>, the Nullness Checker interprets it as
\<@NonNull Date>.

The type system applies that default qualifier to most but
not all type uses.  In particular, unless otherwise stated, every type system
uses the CLIMB-to-top rule.  This
rule states that the \emph{top} qualifier in the hierarchy is the default for
the CLIMB locations:  \textbf{C}asts, \textbf{L}ocals, \textbf{I}nstanceof,
and (some) i\textbf{M}plicit \textbf{B}ounds.
For example, when the user writes an unqualified type such as \<Date> in such a
location, the Nullness Checker interprets it as \<@Nullable Date> (because
\refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{Nullable} is the top qualifier in the
hierarchy, see Figure~\ref{fig-nullness-hierarchy}).

% TODO:  Add wildcard bounds to the set of type-refined locations?
% Especially in light of
% https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/issues/260

The CLIMB-to-top rule is used only for unannotated source code that is
being processed by a checker.  For unannotated libraries (code read by the
compiler in \<.class> or \<.jar> form), see Section~\ref{defaults-classfile}.

The rest of this section explains the rationale and implementation of
CLIMB-to-top.

Here is the rationale for CLIMB-to-top:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Local variables are defaulted to top because type refinement
(Section~\ref{type-refinement}) is applied to local variables.  If a local
variable starts as the top type, then the Checker Framework refines it to
the best (most specific) possible type based on assignments to it.  As a
result, a programmer rarely writes an explicit annotation on any of those
locations.

Variables defaulted to top include local variables, resource variables in the
try-with-resources construct, variables in \<for> statements, and \<catch>
arguments (known as exception parameters in the Java Language Specification).
Exception parameters need to have the top type because
exceptions of arbitrary qualified types can be thrown and the Checker Framework
does not provide runtime checks.

\item
Cast and instanceof types
are given the same type as their argument expression.  This has the same
effect as if they were given the
top type and then flow-sensitively refined to the type of their argument.

\item
Implicit upper bounds are defaulted to top to allow them to be instantiated
in any way.  If a user declared \code{class C<T> \ttlcb\ ...\ \ttrcb}, then
the Checker Framework assumes that the user intended to allow any instantiation of the class,
and the declaration is interpreted as \code{class C<T extends @Nullable
  Object> \ttlcb\ ...\ \ttrcb} rather than as \code{class C<T extends
  @NonNull Object> \ttlcb\ ...\ \ttrcb}.  The latter would forbid
instantiations such as \code{C<@Nullable String>}, or would require
rewriting of code.  On the other hand, if a user writes an explicit bound
such as \code{class C<T extends D> \ttlcb\ ...\ \ttrcb}, then the user
intends some restriction on instantiation and can write a qualifier on the
upper bound as desired.

This rule means that the upper bound of \code{class C<T>} is defaulted
differently than the upper bound of \code{class C<T extends Object>}.
This may seem confusing, but it is the least bad option.  The
more confusing alternative would be for ``\code{Object}'' to be defaulted
differently in \code{class C<T extends Object>} and in an
instantiation \code{C<Object>}, and for the upper bounds to be defaulted
differently in \code{class C<T extends Object>}
and \code{class C<T extends Date>}.

\item
Implicit \emph{lower} bounds are defaulted to the bottom type, again to allow
maximal instantiation.  Note that Java does not allow a programmer to
express both the upper and lower bounds of a type, but the Checker
Framework allows the programmer to specify either or both;
see Section~\ref{generics-defaults}.

\end{itemize}

A \refqualclass{framework/qual}{DefaultQualifier} that specifies a
CLIMB-to-top location takes precedence over the CLIMB-to-top rule.

Here is how the Nullness Checker overrides part of the CLIMB-to-top rule:

\begin{Verbatim}
@DefaultQualifierInHierarchy
@DefaultFor({ TypeUseLocation.EXCEPTION_PARAMETER })
public @interface NonNull {}

public @interface Nullable {}
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
 As mentioned above, the exception parameters are always non-null, so
\<@DefaultFor(\{ TypeUseLocation.EXCEPTION\_PARAMETER \})> on \<@NonNull> overrides
the CLIMB-to-top rule.


\subsectionAndLabel{Inherited defaults}{inherited-defaults}

In certain situations, it would be convenient for an annotation on a
superclass member to be automatically inherited by subclasses that override
it.  This feature would reduce both annotation effort and program
comprehensibility.  In general, a program is read more often than it is
edited/annotated, so the Checker Framework does not currently support this
feature.

Currently, a user can determine the annotation on a parameter or return
value by looking at a single file.  If annotations could be inherited from
supertypes, then a user would have to examine all supertypes, and do
computations over them, to understand the meaning of an unannotated type in
a given file.

Computation is necessary because different annotations might be inherited
from a supertype and an interface, or from two interfaces.  For return
types, the inherited type should be the least upper bound of all
annotations on overridden implementations in supertypes.  For method
parameters, the inherited type should be the greatest lower bound of all
annotations on overridden implementations in supertypes.  In each case, an
error would be thrown if no such annotations existed.

In the future, this feature may be added optionally, and each type-checker
implementation can enable it if desired.


\subsectionAndLabel{Inherited wildcard annotations}{inherited-wildcard-annotations}

If a wildcard is unbounded and has no annotation (e.g. \code{List<?>}),
the annotations on the wildcard's bounds are copied from the type parameter
to which the wildcard is an argument.

For example, the two wildcards in
the declarations below are equivalent.

\begin{Verbatim}
class MyList<@Nullable T extends @Nullable Object> {}

MyList<?> listOfNullables;
MyList<@Nullable ? extends @Nullable Object> listOfNullables;
\end{Verbatim}

The Checker Framework copies
these annotations because wildcards must be within the bounds of their
corresponding type parameter.
By contrast, if the bounds of a wildcard
were defaulted differently from the bounds of its corresponding type
parameter, then there would be many false positive
\code{type.argument.type.incompatible} warnings.

Here is another example of two equivalent wildcard declarations:

\begin{Verbatim}
class MyList<@Regex(5) T extends @Regex(1) Object> {}

MyList<?> listOfRegexes;
MyList<@Regex(5) ? extends @Regex(1) Object> listOfRegexes;
\end{Verbatim}

Note, this copying of annotations for a wildcard's bounds applies only to
unbounded wildcards.  The two wildcards in the
following example are equivalent.

\begin{Verbatim}
class MyList<@NonNull T extends @Nullable Object> {}

MyList<? extends Object> listOfNonNulls;
MyList<@NonNull ? extends @NonNull Object> listOfNonNulls2;
\end{Verbatim}

Note, the upper bound of the wildcard \code{?~extends Object} is defaulted to
\code{@NonNull} using the CLIMB-to-top rule (see Section~\ref{climb-to-top}).
Also note that the \code{MyList} class declaration could have been more succinctly
written as: \code{class MyList<T extends @Nullable Object>} where the lower bound
is implicitly the bottom annotation: \code {@NonNull}.

\subsectionAndLabel{Default qualifiers for \<.class> files (library defaults)}{defaults-classfile}

(\emph{Note:} Currently, the conservative library defaults presented in this section
are off by default and can be turned on by supplying the \<-AuseDefaultsForUncheckedcode=bytecode>
command-line option.  In a future release, they will be turned on
by default and it will be possible to turn them off by supplying a
\<-AuseDefaultsForUncheckedCode=-bytecode> command-line option.)

The defaulting rules presented so far apply to source code that is read by
the compiler.  When the compiler reads a \<.class> file, different
defaulting rules apply.

If the checker was run during the compiler execution that created the
\<.class> file,
%% This caveat is true, but it's a distraction at this point in the manual.
%% Also, not having a top and a bottom qualifier is an uncommon case.
% (and the qualifier hierarchy has both a top and a bottom
% qualifier, see Section~\ref{bottom-and-top-qualifier}),
then there is no need for
defaults:  the \<.class> file has an explicit qualifier at each type use.
(Furthermore, unless warnings were suppressed, those qualifiers are
guaranteed to be correct.)
When you are performing pluggable type-checking,
it is best to ensure that the compiler only reads such \<.class> files.
Section~\ref{compiling-libraries} discusses how to create annotated
libraries.
%% True, but not relevant to the point of this paragraph.
% , even if the library source code is only partially annotated.

If the checker was not run during the compiler execution that created the
\<.class> file, then the \<.class> file contains only the type qualifiers
that the programmer wrote explicitly.  (Furthermore, there is no guarantee
that these qualifiers are correct, since they have not been checked.)
In this case, each checker decides what qualifier to use for the
locations where the programmer did not write an annotation.  Unless otherwise noted, the
choice is:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For method parameters and lower bounds, use the bottom qualifier (see
  Section~\ref{creating-bottom-qualifier}).
\item
  For method return values, fields, and upper bounds, use the top qualifier (see
  Section~\ref{creating-top-qualifier}).
\end{itemize}

These choices are conservative.  They are likely to cause many
false-positive type-checking errors, which will help you to know which
library methods need annotations.  You can then write those library
annotations (see Chapter~\ref{annotating-libraries}) or alternately
suppress the warnings (see Chapter~\ref{suppressing-warnings}).

For example, an unannotated method

\begin{Verbatim}
  String concatenate(String p1, String p2)
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
in a classfile would be interpreted as

\begin{Verbatim}
  @Top String concatenate(@Bottom String p1, @Bottom String p2)
\end{Verbatim}

There is no single possible default that is sound for fields.  In the rare
circumstance that there is a mutable public field in an unannotated
library, the Checker Framework may fail to warn about code that can
misbehave at run time.

%% TODO: The following rule is preferable to the current safe behavior.
%% However, we have not yet figured out how to implement separate handling
%% for field read vs. write.
% For fields, use the bottom qualifier when writing to the field and the
% top qualifier when reading from the field.

%% TODO: should give rules for other locations, such as type parameters
%% (which should behave like fields), bounds, etc.

% If you supply the command-line option
% \<-AunsafeDefaultsForUnannotatedBytecode>,
% then the checker does defaulting for unannotated bytecode like it does for
% annotated source code.  In other words, when a type use in a \<.class> file
% has no explicit annotation, it is defaulted using the same rules as for the
% corresponding source code location.  You should only use this command-line
% option as temporary measure, because it is unsafe:  the checker might issue
% no warnings even though the code could violate the type guarantee at run
% time.  However, it can be useful when you are first annotating a codebase,
% to help you focus on errors within the codebase before you have annotated
% external libraries.

% TODO: document
% the \refqualclass{framework/qual}{DefaultInUncheckedCodeFor}
% and \refqualclass{framework/qual}{DefaultQualifierInHierarchyInUncheckedCode}
% annotations for type system designers.


\sectionAndLabel{Automatic type refinement (flow-sensitive type qualifier inference)}{type-refinement}

The
checkers soundly treat local variables and expressions within a method body as having a
subtype of their declared or defaulted (Section~\ref{defaults})
type.
This functionality
reduces your burden of annotating types in your program and
eliminates some false positive warnings, but it
never introduces unsoundness nor causes an error to be missed.
This functionality works within a method, but you still need to
annotate method signatures (parameter and return type) and field types.

By default all checkers
automatically incorporate type refinement.  Most of the time, users don't
have to think about, and may not even notice, type refinement.
(And most readers can skip reading this section of the manual, except
possibly the examples in Section~\ref{type-refinement-examples}.)
The
checkers simply do the right thing even when a programmer omits an
annotation on a local variable, or when a programmer writes an
unnecessarily general type in a declaration.

The functionality has a variety of names:  automatic type refinement,
flow-sensitive type qualifier inference, local type inference, and
sometimes just ``flow''.

If you find examples where you think a value should be inferred to have
(or not have) a
given annotation, but the checker does not do so, please submit a bug
report (see Section~\ref{reporting-bugs}) that includes a small piece of
Java code that reproduces the problem.


\subsectionAndLabel{Type refinement examples}{type-refinement-examples}

Suppose you write

\begin{Verbatim}
  @Nullable String myVar;
  ...
  if (myVar != null) {
    myVar.hashCode();
  }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The Nullness Checker issues a warning whenever a method such as
\<hashCode()> is called on a possibly-null value, which  may result in a
null pointer exception.
However, the Nullness Checker does not issue a warning for the call
\<myVar.hashCode()>
in the code above.
Within the body
of the \<if> test, the type of \<myVar> is \<@NonNull String>, even though
\<myVar> is declared as \<@Nullable String>.

Here is another example:

\begin{Verbatim}
  @Nullable String myVar;
  ...                   // myVar has type @Nullable String
  myVar = "hello";
  ...                   // myVar has type @NonNull String
  myVar.hashCode();
  ...
  myVar = myMap.get(someKey);
  ...                   // myVar has type @Nullable String
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The Nullness Checker does not issue a warning for
the call \<myVar.hashCode()> above because after the assignment,
the type-checker
treats \<myVar> as having type \<@NonNull String>, which is more precise
than the programmer-written type.


Flow-sensitive type refinement applies to every checker, including new
checkers that you write.  Here is an example for the Regex Checker
(\chapterpageref{regex-checker}):

\begin{Verbatim}
  void m2(@Unannotated String s) {
    s = RegexUtil.asRegex(s, 2);  // asRegex throws error if arg is not a regex
                                  // with the given number of capturing groups
    ...   // s now has type "@Regex(2) String"
  }
\end{Verbatim}


As a further example,
consider this code, along with comments indicating whether the
Nullness Checker (Chapter~\ref{nullness-checker}) issues a warning.  Note that the same expression may yield a
warning or not depending on its context.

\begin{Verbatim}
  // Requires an argument of type @NonNull String
  void parse(@NonNull String toParse) { ... }

  // Argument does NOT have a @NonNull type
  void lex(@Nullable String toLex) {
    parse(toLex);        // warning:  toLex might be null
    if (toLex != null) {
      parse(toLex);      // no warning:  toLex is known to be non-null
    }
    parse(toLex);        // warning:  toLex might be null
    toLex = new String(...);
    parse(toLex);        // no warning:  toLex is known to be non-null
  }
\end{Verbatim}

This example shows the general rules for when
the Nullness Checker (Chapter~\ref{nullness-checker}) can automatically
determine that certain variables are non-null, even if they were explicitly
or by default annotated as nullable.
The checker treats a variable or expression as \refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{NonNull}:
\begin{itemize}
\item
starting at the time that it is either
assigned a non-null value or checked against null (e.g., via an assertion,
\code{if} statement, or being dereferenced)
\item
until it might be re-assigned (e.g.,
via an assignment that might affect this variable, or via a method call
that might affect this variable).
\end{itemize}


The inference indicates when a variable can be treated as having a subtype
of its declared type --- for instance, when an otherwise nullable type can be
treated as a \refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{NonNull} one.  The inference never treats a variable as
a supertype of its declared type (e.g., an expression with declared type \refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{NonNull}
type is never inferred to be treated as possibly-null).



\subsectionAndLabel{Types that are not refined}{type-refinement-types-that-are-not-refined}

Array element types and generic arguments are never changed by type
refinement.  Changing these components of a type never yields a subtype of
the declared type.
For example, \code{List<Number>} is \emph{not} a
subtype of \code{List<Object>}.  Similarly, the Checker Framework does not
treat \code{Number[]} as a subtype of
\code{Object[]}.
For details, see Section~\ref{covariant-type-parameters} and
Section~\ref{invariant-arrays}.


\subsectionAndLabel{Run-time tests and type refinement}{type-refinement-runtime-tests}

Some type systems support a run-time test that the Checker Framework can
use to refine types within the scope of a conditional such as \<if>, after
an \<assert> statement, etc.

Whether a type system supports such a run-time test depends on whether the
type system is computing properties of data itself, or properties of
provenance (the source of the data).  An example of a property about data is
whether a string is a regular expression.  An example of a property about
provenance is units of measure:  there is no way to look at the
representation of a number and determine whether it is intended to
represent kilometers or miles.

% Keep these lists in sync with the list in introduction.tex

Type systems that support a run-time test are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \ahrefloc{nullness-checker}{Nullness Checker} for null pointer errors
  (see \chapterpageref{nullness-checker})

\subsectionAndLabel{Fields and flow-sensitive analysis}{type-refinement-fields}

Flow sensitivity analysis infers the type of fields in some restricted cases:

\begin{itemize}

\item
A final initialized field:
Type inference is performed for final fields that are initialized to a
compile-time constant at the declaration site; so the type of \code{protocol}
is \code{@NonNull String} in the following declaration:

\begin{Verbatim}
    public final String protocol = "https";
\end{Verbatim}

Such an inferred type may leak to the public interface of the class.
If you wish to override such behavior, you can explicitly insert the desired
annotation, e.g.,

\begin{Verbatim}
    public final @Nullable String protocol = "https";
\end{Verbatim}

\item
Within method bodies:
Type inference is performed for fields in the context of method bodies,
like local variables.
Consider the following example, where \code{updatedAt} is a nullable
field:

\begin{Verbatim}
class DBObject {
  @Nullable Date updatedAt;

  void m() {
    // updatedAt is @Nullable, so warning about .getTime()
    ... updatedAt.getTime() ... // warning about possible NullPointerException

    if (updatedAt == null) {
      updatedAt = new Date();
    }

    // updatedAt is now @NonNull, so .getTime() call is OK
    ... updatedAt.getTime() ...
  }
}
\end{Verbatim}

Here the call to \code{persistData()} invalidates the inferred non-null type
of \code{updatedAt}.

A method call may invalidate inferences about field types; see
Section~\ref{type-refinement-purity}.

\end{itemize}


\subsectionAndLabel{Side effects, determinism, purity, and flow-sensitive analysis}{type-refinement-purity}

Side effect analysis is important for helping a checker reason about the
values of expressions.

As described above, a checker can use a refined type for an expression from
the time when the checker infers that the value has that refined type,
until the checker can no longer support that inference.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The refined type \emph{begins} at a test (such as \<if (myvar != null)
  ...>) or an assignment.  If the assignment occurs within a method body,
  you can write a postcondition annotation such as
  \refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{EnsuresNonNull}.
\item
  The refined type \emph{ends} at an assignment or possible assignment.
  Any method call has the potential to side-effect any field, so calling a
  method typically causes the checker to discard its knowledge of the
  refined type.  This is undesirable if the method doesn't actually
  re-assign the field.
\end{itemize}

There are three annotations, collectively called purity annotations, that
you can use to help express what effects a method call does not have.
Usually, you only need to use \refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{SideEffectFree}.


\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{SideEffectFree}]
  indicates that the method has no externally-visible side effects.

\item[\refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{Deterministic}]
  indicates that if the method is called multiple times with identical
  arguments, then it returns the identical result according to \<==>
  (not just according to \<equals()>).

\item[\refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{Pure}]
  indicates that the method is both \<@SideEffectFree> and \<@Deterministic>.

\end{description}

The Javadoc of the annotations describes their semantics and how they are
checked.  This manual section gives examples and supplementary information.

For example, consider the
following declarations and uses:

\begin{Verbatim}
  @Nullable Object myField;

  int computeValue() { ... }

  void m() {
    ...
    if (myField != null) {
      int result = computeValue();
      myField.toString();
    }
  }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
Ordinarily, the Nullness Checker would issue a warning regarding the
\code{toString()} call, because the receiver \code{myField} might be
\code{null}, according to the \code{@Nullable} annotation on the
declaration of \code{myField}.  Even though the code checked the value of
\<myField>, the call to \<computeValue> might have re-set \<myField> to null.
If you change the declaration of \code{computeValue} to

\begin{Verbatim}
  @SideEffectFree
  int computeValue() { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
then the Nullness Checker issues no warnings, because it can reason that
the second occurrence of \code{myField} has the same (non-null) value as
the one in the test.

As a more complex example, consider the
following declaration and uses:

\begin{Verbatim}
  @Nullable Object getField(Object arg) { ... }

  void m() {
    ...
    if (x.getField(y) != null) {
      x.getField(y).toString();
    }
  }
\end{Verbatim}

Ordinarily, the Nullness Checker would issue a warning regarding the
\code{toString()} call, because the receiver \code{x.getField(y)} might
be \code{null}, according to the \code{@Nullable} annotation in the
declaration of \code{getField}.  If you change the declaration of
\code{getField} to

\begin{Verbatim}
  @Pure
  @Nullable Object getField(Object arg) { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
then the Nullness Checker issues no warnings, because it can reason that
the two invocations \code{x.getField(y)} have the same value, and
therefore that \code{x.getField(y)} is non-null within the then branch
of the if statement.


If you supply the command-line option \<-AsuggestPureMethods>, then the
Checker Framework will suggest methods that can be marked as
\<@SideEffectFree>, \<@Deterministic>, or \<@Pure>.

% Maybe this ambiguous option, which enables checking whether method
% bodies are compatible with the method declaration annotation, should be
% renamed, such as to -AcheckPurity.

Currently, purity annotations are trusted.  Purity annotations on called
methods affect type-checking of client code.  However, you can make a
mistake by writing \<@SideEffectFree> on the declaration of a method that
is not actually side-effect-free or by writing \<@Deterministic> on the
declaration of a method that is not actually deterministic.  To enable
checking of the annotations, supply the command-line option
\<-AcheckPurityAnnotations>.  It is not enabled by default because of a high false
positive rate.  In the future, after a new purity-checking analysis is
implemented, the Checker Framework will default to checking purity
annotations.

It can be tedious to annotate library methods with purity annotations such
as \<@SideEffectFree>.  If you supply the command-line option
\<-AassumeSideEffectFree>, then the Checker Framework will unsoundly
assume that every called method is side-effect-free.  This can make
flow-sensitive type refinement much more effective, since method calls will
not cause the analysis to discard information that it has learned.
However, this option can mask real errors.  It is most appropriate when you
are starting out annotating a project, or if you are using the Checker
Framework to find some bugs but not to give a guarantee that no more errors
exist of the given type.

A common error is:

\begin{mysmall}
\begin{Verbatim}
MyClass.java:1465: error: int hashCode() in MyClass cannot override int hashCode(Object this) in java.lang.Object;
attempting to use an incompatible purity declaration
    public int hashCode() {
               ^
  found   : []
  required: [SIDE_EFFECT_FREE, DETERMINISTIC]
\end{Verbatim}
\end{mysmall}

\noindent
The reason for the error is that the \<Object> class is annotated as:

\begin{Verbatim}
class Object {
  ...
  @Pure int hashCode() { ... }
}
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
(where \refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{Pure} means both
\refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{SideEffectFree} and
\refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{Deterministic}).  Every overriding
definition, including those in your program, must use be at least as strong
a specification; in particular, every overriding definition must be
annotated as \<@Pure>.

You can fix the definition by adding \<@Pure> to your method definition.
Alternately, you can suppress the warning.
You can suppress each such warning individually using
\<@SuppressWarnings("purity.invalid.overriding")>,
or you can use the \<-AsuppressWarnings=purity.invalid.overriding>
command-line argument to suppress all such warnings.
% The \<-AassumeSideEffectFree> command-line argument suppresses the
% warning, but it does more too; don't mention it here.
In the future, the Checker Framework will support inheriting annotations
from superclass definitions.



The \refqualclass{dataflow/qual}{TerminatesExecution} annotation
indicates that a given method never returns.  This can enable the
flow-sensitive type refinement to be more precise.


% This is a slightly funny place for this section, but I cannot decide on a
% better one.
\subsectionAndLabel{Assertions}{type-refinement-assertions}

If your code contains an \<assert> statement, then your code could behave
in two different ways at run time, depending on whether assertions are
enabled or disabled
via the \<-ea> or \<-da> command-line options to java.

By default, the Checker Framework outputs warnings about any error that
could happen at run time, whether assertions are enabled or disabled.

If you supply the \<-AassumeAssertionsAreEnabled> command-line option, then
the Checker Framework assumes assertions are enabled.  If you supply the
\<-AassumeAssertionsAreDisabled> command-line option, then the Checker
Framework assumes assertions are disabled.  You may not supply both
command-line options.  It is uncommon to supply either one.

These command-line arguments have no effect on processing of \<assert>
statements whose message contains the text \<@AssumeAssertion>; see
Section~\ref{assumeassertion}.


% If you add a Javadoc link to this location, also add the qualifier to the
% list below.
\sectionAndLabel{Writing Java expressions as annotation arguments}{java-expressions-as-arguments}

Sometimes, it is necessary to write a Java expression as the argument to an
annotation.  The annotations that take a Java
expression as an argument include:

% TODO: Need to periodically check/update this list.
\begin{itemize}
\item \refqualclass{framework/qual}{RequiresQualifier}
\item \refqualclass{framework/qual}{EnsuresQualifier}
\item \refqualclass{framework/qual}{EnsuresQualifierIf}
\item \refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{RequiresNonNull}
\item \refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{EnsuresNonNull}
\item \refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{EnsuresNonNullIf}
% Not implemented: \refqualclass{checker/nullness/qual}{AssertNonNullIfNonNull}

\item \refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{EnsuresLockHeldIf}
\item \refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{GuardedBy}
\item \refqualclass{checker/lock/qual}{Holding}
\end{itemize}

The set of permitted expressions is a subset of all Java expressions:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  the receiver object, \<this>.  You can write \<this> to annotate any
  variable or declaration where you could write \<this> in code.
  Notably, it cannot be used in annotations on declarations of
  static fields or methods.  For a field, \<this> is the field's
  receiver, i.e. its container.  For a local variable, it is the
  method's receiver.

\item
  the receiver object as seen from the superclass, \<super>.  This can be used
  to refer to fields shadowed in the subclass (although shadowing fields is
  discouraged in Java).

\item
  \code{<self>}, i.e. the value of the annotated reference (non-primitive) variable.
  Currently only defined for the \<@GuardedBy> type system.
  For example, \code{@GuardedBy("<self>") Object o} indicates that the value
  referenced by \<o> is guarded by the intrinsic (monitor) lock of the value
  referenced by \<o>.

\item
  a formal parameter, represented as \<\#> followed by the \textbf{one-based} parameter
  index.  For example: \<\#1>, \<\#3>.  It is not permitted to write \<\#0> to
  refer to the receiver object; use \<this> instead.  (A side note:
  The formal parameter syntax \<\#1> is less natural in source code
  than writing the formal parameter name.  This syntax is necessary for
  separate compilation, when an annotated method has already been compiled
  into a \<.class> file and a client of that method is later compiled.
  In the \<.class> file, no formal parameter name information is available,
  so it is necessary to use a number to indicate a formal parameter.)
%% At some point, we will start assuming that the .class file was created
%% by the Checker Framework and this justification, and the #n syntax
%% itself, will not be necessary.
% Running
% the compiler without a checker should create legal annotations in the
% \<.class> file, so we cannot rely on the checker to translate names to
% indices.

\item
  a local variable.  Write the variable name.  For example: \<myLocalVar>.
  The variable must be in scope; for example, a method annotation on method
  \<m> cannot mention a local variable that is declared inside \<m>.

\item
  a static variable.  Write the class name and the variable, as in
  \<System.out>.

\item
  a field of any expression.  For example:  \<next>,
  \<this.next>, \<\#1.next>. %, \<myLocalVar.next>.
  You may optionally omit a leading ``\<this.>'', just as in Java.  Thus,
  \<this.next> and \<next> are equivalent.

\item
  an array access.  For example:  \<this.myArray[i]>, \<vals[\#1]>.

\item literals: string, integer, long, null, class literals.

\item a method invocation on any expression.
  This even works for overloaded methods and methods with type parameters.
  For example:
  \<m1(x, y.z, \#2)>, \<a.m2("hello")>.

  One unusual feature of the Checker Framework's Java expressions is that a
  method call is allowed to have side effects.  Other tools forbid methods
  with side effects (and doing so is necessary if a specification is going
  to be checked at run time via assertions).  The Checker Framework enables
  you to state more facts.  For example, consider the annotation on
  \<java.io.BufferedReader.ready()>:

\begin{Verbatim}
  @EnsuresNonNullIf(expression="readLine()", result=true)
  @Pure public boolean ready() throws IOException { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

  This states that if \<readLine()> is called immediately after \<ready()>
  returns true, then \<readLine()> returns a non-null value.
  Currently, the Checker Framework cannot prove all contracts about method
  calls, so you may need to suppress some warnings.

\end{itemize}

% We want this in the future:
% The expression may refer to private fields and method calls.  The client
% cannot directly make use of these private fields and method calls, but they
% may be useful in establishing a precondition that itself refers to private
% fields or methods.  This exposure of implementation details is unfortunate,
% but it enables more expressive and useful specifications to be written, it does not jeopardize soundness nor let the client manipulate the
% representation, and it is simple
% simpler than defining specification fields or ghost fields
%% TODO: we may eventually have an @SpecField annotation


\textbf{Limitations:}
The following Java expressions may not currently be written:
% The Checker Framework is best at reasoning about Java expressions that
% are variable references, but these expressions are not.
\begin{itemize}
\item Some literals:  floats, doubles, and chars.
\item String concatenation expressions.
\item Mathematical operators (plus, minus, division, ...).
\item Comparisons (equality, less than, etc.).
\end{itemize}

Additionally, it is not possible to write
quantification over all array components (e.g. to express that all
  array elements are non-null).  There is no such Java expression, but it
  would be useful when writing specifications.

\sectionAndLabel{Field invariants}{field-invariants}

Sometimes a field declared in a superclass has a more precise type in a
subclass.  To express this fact, write
\refqualclass{framework/qual}{FieldInvariant} on the subclass. It specifies
the field's type in the class on which this annotation is written.
The field must be declared in a superclass and
must be final.

% Other possible examples:
% Vehicles have some number of wheels; motorcycles have exactly 2 wheels.
% Sentence: subject (missing for imperative, which would let us use
%   @Unused, but that's not the point here), verb, object (optional,
%   missing for some types of sentences?).
% Book might have an index
% DOM tree might have parent or not.
% Computer might have a sound card or not.

For example,
\begin{Verbatim}
class Person {
  final @Nullable String nickname;
  public Person(@Nullable String nickname) {
    this.nickname = nickname;
  }
}

// A rapper always has a nickname.
@FieldInvariant(qualifier = NonNull.class, field = "nickname")
class Rapper extends Person {
  public Rapper(String nickname) {
    super(nickname);
  }
  void method() {
    ... nickname.length() ...   // legal, nickname is non-null in this class.
  }
}
\end{Verbatim}
 A field invariant annotation can refer to more than one field. For example,
\<@FieldInvariant(qualifier = NonNull.class, field = \{fieldA, fieldB\})> means
that \<fieldA> and \<fieldB> are both non-null in the class upon which the
annotation is written.  A field invariant annotation
can also apply different qualifiers to different fields. For example,
\<@FieldInvariant(qualifier = \{NonNull.class, Untainted.class\}, field =
\{fieldA, fieldB\})> means that \<fieldA> is non-null and \<fieldB> is untainted.

This annotation is inherited:  if a superclass is annotated with
\<@FieldInvariant>, its subclasses have the same annotation. If a subclass has its
own \<@FieldInvariant>, then it must include the fields in the superclass
annotation and those fields' annotations must be a subtype (or equal) to the
annotations for those fields in the superclass \<@FieldInvariant>.

Currently, the \<@FieldInvariant> annotation is trusted rather than
checked.  In other words, the \<@FieldInvariant> annotation introduces a
loophole in the type system, which requires verification by other means
such as manual examination.


% \sectionAndLabel{Unused fields and dependent types}{unused-fields-and-dependent-types}
\sectionAndLabel{Unused fields}{unused-fields}

In an inheritance hierarchy, subclasses often introduce new methods and
fields.  For example, a \<Marsupial> (and its subclasses such as
\<Kangaroo>) might have a variable \<pouchSize> indicating the size of the animal's
pouch.  The field does not exist in superclasses such as
\<Mammal> and \<Animal>, so Java issues a compile-time
error if a program tries to access \<myMammal.pouchSize>.

If you cannot use subtypes in your program, you can enforce similar
requirements using type qualifiers.
For fields, use the \<@Unused> annotation (Section~\ref{unused-annotation}), which enforces that a field or method may only
be accessed from a receiver expression with a given annotation (or one of
its subtypes).
For methods, annotate the receiver parameter \<this>; then a method call
type-checks only if the actual receiver is of the specified type.

% For example, consider the declaration
%   void getChars(@Untainted String this, int srcBegin, int srcEnd, char[] dst,
%   int dstBegin) { ... }
% Now, the invocation
%   myString.getChars(a, b, c, d)
% type-checks only if myString has type @Untainted String.  It does not
% type-check if myString has type @Tainted String.


% Then,
% Section~\ref{dependent-types} describes an even more powerful mechanism, by
% which the qualifier of a field depends on the qualifier of the expression
% from which the field was accessed.

Also see the discussion of typestate checkers, in
Chapter~\ref{typestate-checker}.


% \subsectionAndLabel{Unused fields}{unused-fields}
\subsectionAndLabel{\<@Unused> annotation}{unused-annotation}

A Java subtype can have more fields than its supertype.  For example:

\begin{Verbatim}
class Animal {}
class Mammal extends Animal { ... }
class Marsupial extends Mammal {
  int pouchSize;  // pouch capacity, in cubic centimeters
  ...
}
\end{Verbatim}

You can simulate
the same effect for type qualifiers:
the \refqualclass{framework/qual}{Unused} annotation
on a field declares that the field may \emph{not} be accessed via a receiver of
the given qualified type (or any \emph{super}type).
% a given field \emph{may not} be accessed via
% a reference with a supertype qualifier, but \emph{may} be accessed via a reference
% with a subtype qualifier.
%% The following is true, but there's no need to distract readers with this detail.
% (It would probably be clearer to replace \<@Unused> by an annotation that
% indicates when the field \emph{may} be used.)
For example:

\begin{Verbatim}
class Animal {
  @Unused(when=Mammal.class)
  int pouchSize;  // pouch capacity, in cubic centimeters
  ...
}
@interface Mammal {}
@interface Marsupial {}

@Marsupial Animal joey = ...;
... joey.pouchSize ...    // OK
@Mammal Animal mae = ...;
... mae.pouchSize ...    // compile-time error
\end{Verbatim}

The above class declaration is like writing

\begin{Verbatim}
class @Mammal-Animal { ... }
class @Marsupial-Animal {
  int pouchSize;  // pouch capacity, in cubic centimeters
  ...
}
\end{Verbatim}


% \subsectionAndLabel{Dependent types}{dependent-types}
%
% A variable has a \emph{dependent type} if its type depends on some other
% value or type.
% %  --- the type is dynamically, not statically, determined.
% % (Type-safety can still be statically determined, though.)
%
% The Checker Framework supports a form of dependent types, via the
% \refqualclass{framework/qual}{Dependent} annotation.
% This annotation changes the type of a reference, based on the
% qualified type of the receiver (\code{this}).  This can be viewed as a more
% expressive form of polymorphism (see Section~\ref{polymorphism}).  It can
% also be seen as a way of linking the meanings of two type qualifier
% hierarchies.
%
% When the \refqualclass{framework/qual}{Unused} annotation is sufficient, you
% should use it instead of \code{@Dependent}.
%
% Here is a restatement of the example of Section~\ref{unused-fields}, using
% \refqualclass{framework/qual}{Dependent}:
%
% \begin{Verbatim}
% @interface Mammal {}
% @interface Marsupial {}
% class Animal {
%   // pouch capacity, in cubic centimeters
%   // (non-null if this animal is a marsupial)
%   @Nullable @Dependent(result=NonNull.class, when=Marsupial.class) Integer getPouchSize;
%   ...
% }
%
% @Marsupial Animal joey = ...;
% ... joey.getPouchSize().intValue() ...    // OK
% @Mammal Animal mae = ...;
% ... mae.getPouchSize().intValue() ...    // compile-time error:
%                                          //   dereference of possibly-null mae.getPouchSize()
% \end{Verbatim}
%
% Just as writing \<@Unused> is similar to writing multiple classes (but when
% it is not possible to write real subclasses), \<@Dependent> mimics the
% effect of multiple classes with overriding definitions of some method or
% field.
% The above class declaration is like writing
%
% \begin{Verbatim}
% class @Mammal-Animal {
%   // pouch capacity, in cubic centimeters
%   // (non-null if this animal is a marsupial)
%   @Nullable Integer getPouchSize();
% }
% class @Marsupial-Animal {
%   // pouch capacity, in cubic centimeters
%   @NonNull Integer getPouchSize();
%   ...
% }
% \end{Verbatim}
%
%
% \subsubsectionAndLabel{Limitations of \<@Dependent>}{dependent-types-limitations}
%
% It is unsound to write \<@Dependent> on a non-\<final> field.  Consider the
% following:
%
% \begin{Verbatim}
% class MyClass {
%   @Nullable @Dependent(result=NonNull.class, when=Marsupial.class) Integer pouchSize;
% }
% \end{Verbatim}
%
% Then it would be possible to write
%
% \begin{Verbatim}
% @Marsupial Animal a = new @Marsupial Animal();
% @Mammal Animal b = a;
% b.pouchSize = null;
% a.pouchSize.intValue();
% \end{Verbatim}
%
% \noindent
% In the last line of the example, \<a.pouchSize> is null, contradicting its
% declaration and leading to a null pointer exception that would not be
% caught by the type-checker.
%
% In certain circumstances, it may be desirable to write such an annotation
% on a \<private> field anyway, manually check all uses, and then suppress
% the warning.
%
% It is sound to write \<@Dependent> on a \<final> field.  Such a field
% behaves like a getter method, such as \<getPouchSize()> above.
