\chapter{Third-party checkers\label{third-party-checkers}\label{external-checkers}}

The Checker Framework has been used to build other checkers that are not
distributed together with the framework.  This chapter mentions just a few
of them.  They are listed in chronological order; older ones appear first
and newer ones appear last.

They are externally-maintained, so if you have problems or questions, you
should contact their maintainers rather than the Checker Framework
maintainers.

If you want a reference to your checker included in this chapter,
send us a link and a short description.


% Note to maintainers:
% Sections are added to this chapter in chronological order.

\section{Units and dimensions checker\label{units-and-dimensions-checker}}

A checker for units and dimensions is available at
\url{http://www.lexspoon.org/expannots/}.

Unlike the Units Checker that is distributed with the Checker Framework
(see Section~\ref{units-checker}), this checker includes dynamic checks and
permits annotation arguments that are Java expressions.  This added
flexibility, however, requires that you use a special version both of the
Checker Framework and of the javac compiler.


\section{Thread locality checker\label{loci-thread-locality-checker}}

Loci~\cite{WrigstadPMZV2009}, a checker for thread locality, is available at
\url{http://www.it.uu.se/research/upmarc/loci/}.
Developer resources are available at the project page
\url{http://java.net/projects/loci/}.

% A paper was publishd in ECOOP 2009, release 0.1 was made in March 2011,
% but as of October 2013 the manual is still listed as "forthcoming".

\section{Safety-Critical Java checker\label{safety-critical-java-checker}}

A checker for Safety-Critical Java (SCJ, JSR 302)~\cite{TangPJ2010} is available at
\url{http://sss.cs.purdue.edu/projects/oscj/checker/checker.html}.
Developer resources are available at the project page
\url{https://code.google.com/archive/p/scj-jsr302/}.

% Name: SCJ Checker
% WWW: http://sss.cs.purdue.edu/projects/oscj/checker/checker.html
% Source-Code Repository: http://code.google.com/p/scj-jsr302/

% Description: The SCJ Checker implements verification of a set of
% annotations defined by the Safety-Critical Java standard (JSR-302).
% The checker mainly focuses on proving memory safety of Java programs
% that use a region-based memory management.

\section{Generic Universe Types checker\label{gut-checker}}

A checker for Generic Universe Types~\cite{DietlEM2011}, a lightweight ownership type
system, is available from
\url{https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wdietl/ownership/}.


\section{EnerJ checker\label{enerj-checker}}

A checker for EnerJ~\cite{SampsonDFGCG2011}, an extension to Java that exposes hardware faults
in a safe, principled manner to save energy with only
slight sacrifices to the quality of service, is available from
\url{http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/research/approximation/enerj.html}.


\section{CheckLT taint checker\label{checklt-checker}}

CheckLT uses taint tracking to detect illegal information flows, such as
unsanitized data that could result in a SQL injection attack.
CheckLT is available from \url{http://checklt.github.io/}.


\section{SPARTA information flow type-checker for Android\label{sparta-checker}}

SPARTA is a security toolset aimed at preventing malware from appearing in
an app store.  SPARTA provides an information-flow type-checker that is
customized to Android but can also be applied to other domains.
The SPARTA toolset is available from
\url{https://checkerframework.org/sparta/}.
The paper
\href{http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/infoflow-ccs2014.pdf}{``Collaborative
    verification of information flow for a high-assurance app store''}
  appeared in CCS 2014.


\section{Immutability checkers:  IGJ, OIGJ, and Javari\label{igj-checker}\label{javari-checker}}

Javari~\cite{TschantzE2005}, IGJ~\cite{ZibinPAAKE2007}, and
OIGJ~\cite{ZibinPLAE2010} are type systems that enforce immutability
constraints.  Type-checkers for all three type systems were distributed
with the Checker Framework through release 1.9.13 (dated 1 April 2016).
If you wish to use them, install
\href{https://checkerframework.org/releases/1.9.13/}{Checker
  Framework version 1.9.13}.

They were removed from the main distribution on June 1, 2016 because the
implementations were not being maintained as the Checker Framework evolved.
The type systems are valuable, and some people found the type-checkers
useful.  However,
% the type-checkers should be rewritten from scratch and
we wanted
to focus on distributing checkers that are currently being maintained.


\section{Read Checker for CERT FIO08-J\label{read-checker}}

CERT
rule \href{https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/FIO08-J.+Distinguish+between+characters+or+bytes+read+from+a+stream+and+-1}{FIO08-J}
describes a rule for the correct handling of characters/bytes read
from a stream.

The Read Checker enforces this rule.
It is available from
\url{https://github.com/opprop/ReadChecker}.


\section{SQL checker that supports multiple dialects\label{sql-schecker}}

\href{http://www.jooq.org/}{jOOQ} is a database API that lets you build
typesafe SQL queries.  jOOQ version 3.0.9 and later ships with a SQL
checker that provides even more safety:  it ensures ensure that you don't
use SQL features that are not not supported by your database
implementation.  You can learn about the SQL checker at
\url{https://blog.jooq.org/2016/05/09/jsr-308-and-the-checker-framework-add-even-more-typesafety-to-jooq-3-9/}.
