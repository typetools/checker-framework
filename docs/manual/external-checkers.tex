\chapterAndLabel{Third-party checkers\label{external-checkers}}{third-party-checkers}

The Checker Framework has been used to build other checkers that are not
distributed together with the framework.  This chapter gives an \emph{incomplete}
list of them.  (If you know of others, or
if you want this chapter to reference your checker,
please send us a link and a short description.)
Many of the publications in Section~\ref{publications} provide
implementations, which are not necessarily listed here yet.

These tools are externally-maintained, so if you have problems or questions, you
should contact their maintainers rather than the Checker Framework
maintainers.

This list is in reverse chronological order; newer tools appear
first and older ones appear last.


% Note to maintainers:
% Sections are added to this chapter in reverse chronological order, at the top.


\sectionAndLabel{Determinism checker}{deteriminism-checker}

The
\href{https://github.com/t-rasmud/checker-framework/tree/nondet-checker}{Determinism
  Checker} ensures that a program is deterministic across executions.  A
determinismic program is easier to test, and it is easier to debug (such as
comparing executions).

The Determinism Checker focuses on sequential programs.  It detects
determinism due to the iteration order of a hash table (or on any other
property of hash codes), default formatting (such as Java's
\<Object.toString()>, which includes a memory address), \<random>,
date-and-time functions, and accessing system properties such as the file
system or environment variables.

The paper ``Verifying determinism in sequential programs''~\cite{MudduluruWME2021} (ICSE 2021,
\url{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/determinism-icse2021-abstract.html})
describes the Determinism Checker.


\sectionAndLabel{NullAway}{nullaway-checker}

\ahref{https://github.com/uber/NullAway}{NullAway}~\cite{BanerjeeCS2019} is
a fast type-checker for only nullness properties.  It is built on top of
Error Prone and the Checker Framework's Dataflow Framework.  See
Section~\ref{faq-nullaway} for a comparison between NullAway and the
Nullness Checker.


\sectionAndLabel{AWS crypto policy compliance checker}{crypto-policy-compliance-checker}

The
\href{https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crypto-policy-compliance-checker}{AWS
  crypto policy compliance checker} checks that no weak cipher algorithms
are used with the Java crypto API\@.

The paper ``Continuous Compliance''~\cite{KelloggSTE2020} (ASE 2020,
\myurl{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/continuous-compliance-ase2020-abstract.html})
describes several custom Checker Framework checkers in the context of a compliance regime at Amazon Web Services.


\sectionAndLabel{AWS KMS compliance checker}{kms-compliance-checker}

The \href{https://github.com/awslabs/aws-kms-compliance-checker}{AWS KMS
  compliance checker} extends the Constant Value Checker (see
\chapterpageref{constant-value-checker}) to enforce that calls to Amazon
Web Services' Key Management System only request 256-bit (or longer) data
keys.  This checker can be used to help enforce a compliance requirement
(such as from SOC or PCI-DSS) that customer data is always encrypted with
256-bit keys.

The KMS compliance checker is available in Maven Central.  To use it in
\<build.gradle>, add the following dependency:

\begin{Verbatim}
compile group: 'software.amazon.checkerframework', name: 'aws-kms-compliance-checker', version: '1.0.2'
\end{Verbatim}

\ahref{https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/software.amazon.checkerframework/aws-kms-compliance-checker/1.0.2}{Other build systems} are similar.

The paper ``Continuous Compliance''~\cite{KelloggSTE2020} (ASE 2020,
\myurl{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/continuous-compliance-ase2020-abstract.html})
describes several custom Checker Framework checkers in the context of a compliance regime at Amazon Web Services.


\sectionAndLabel{UI Thread Checker for ReactiveX}{rx-thread-checker}

The \href{https://www.bennostein.org/ase18.pdf}{Rx Thread \& Effect Checker}~\cite{SteinCSC2018} enforces
UI Thread safety properties for stream-based Android applications and is available at
\url{https://github.com/uber-research/RxThreadEffectChecker}.


\sectionAndLabel{Glacier:  Class immutability}{glacier-immutability-checker}

\href{http://mcoblenz.github.io/Glacier/}{Glacier}~\cite{CoblenzNAMS2017}
enforces transitive class immutability in Java.  According to its webpage:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Transitive: if a class is immutable, then every field must be
  immutable. This means that all reachable state from an immutable object's
  fields is immutable.
\item
  Class: the immutability of an object depends only on its class's
  immutability declaration.
\item
  Immutability: state in an object is not changable through any reference to
  the object.
\end{itemize}


\sectionAndLabel{SQL checker that supports multiple dialects}{sql-schecker}

\href{http://www.jooq.org/}{jOOQ} is a database API that lets you build
typesafe SQL queries.  jOOQ version 3.0.9 and later ships with a SQL
checker that provides even more safety:  it ensures that you don't
use SQL features that are not supported by your database
implementation.  You can learn about the SQL checker at
\url{https://blog.jooq.org/jsr-308-and-the-checker-framework-add-even-more-typesafety-to-jooq-3-9/}.


\sectionAndLabel{Read Checker for CERT FIO08-J}{read-checker}

CERT
rule \href{https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/java/FIO08-J.+Distinguish+between+characters+or+bytes+read+from+a+stream+and+-1}{FIO08-J}
describes a rule for the correct handling of characters/bytes read
from a stream.

The Read Checker enforces this rule.
It is available from
\url{https://github.com/opprop/ReadChecker}.


\sectionAndLabel{Nullness Rawness Checker}{initialization-rawness-checker}

The Nullness Rawness Checker is a variant of the Nullness Checker that uses a different type system for initialization.
It was distributed with the Checker Framework through release 2.9.0 (dated 3 July 2019). If you wish
to use it, install \href{https://checkerframework.org/releases/2.9.0/}{Checker Framework version 2.9.0}.

The paper ``Inference of field initialization''~\cite{SpotoE2011} (ICSE
2011,
\myurl{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/initialization-icse2011-abstract.html})
describes inference for the Rawness Initialization Checker.


\sectionAndLabel{Immutability checkers:  IGJ, OIGJ, and Javari\label{javari-checker}}{igj-checker}

Javari~\cite{TschantzE2005}, IGJ~\cite{ZibinPAAKE2007}, and
OIGJ~\cite{ZibinPLAE2010} are type systems that enforce immutability
constraints.  Type-checkers for all three type systems were distributed
with the Checker Framework through release 1.9.13 (dated 1 April 2016).
If you wish to use them, install
\href{https://checkerframework.org/releases/1.9.13/}{Checker
  Framework version 1.9.13}.

They were removed from the main distribution on June 1, 2016 because the
implementations were not being maintained as the Checker Framework evolved.
The type systems are valuable, and some people found the type-checkers
useful.  However,
% the type-checkers should be rewritten from scratch and
we wanted
to focus on distributing checkers that are currently being maintained.

IGJ and OIGJ are described in the papers
``Object and reference immutability using Java generics''~\cite{ZibinPAAKE2007} (ESEC/FSE 2007, \myurl{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/immutability-generics-fse2007-abstract.html})
and
``Ownership and immutability in generic Java''~\cite{ZibinPLAE2010} (OOPSLA 2010, \myurl{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/ownership-immutability-oopsla2010-abstract.html})
The Javari type system is described in
``Javari: Adding reference immutability to Java''~\cite{TschantzE2005} (OOPSLA 2005, \myurl{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/ref-immutability-oopsla2005-abstract.html});

and
``Parameter reference immutability: Formal definition, inference tool, and comparison''~\cite{ArtziQKE2009} (J.ASE 2009, \myurl{https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/mutability-jase2009-abstract.html}).

previously-unknown errors in real software.


\sectionAndLabel{Error Prone}{error-prone-checker}

% Has used the Dataflow Framework since summer 2014.

\ahref{https://errorprone.info/}{Error Prone} is a linter or bug detector

\sectionAndLabel{Units and dimensions checker}{units-and-dimensions-checker}

A checker for units and dimensions is available at
\url{https://www.lexspoon.org/expannots/}.

Unlike the Units Checker that is distributed with the Checker Framework
(see Section~\ref{units-checker}), this checker includes dynamic checks and
permits annotation arguments that are Java expressions.  This added
flexibility, however, requires that you use a special version both of the
Checker Framework and of the javac compiler.
