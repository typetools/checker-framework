\chapterAndLabel{Resource Leak Checker for must-call obligations}{resource-leak-checker}

The Resource Leak Checker guarantees that the program fulfills every object's
must-call obligations before the object is de-allocated.

A resource leak occurs when a program does not explicitly dispose of some finite
underlying resource, such as a socket, file descriptor, or database connection.  To dispose
of the resource, the program should call some method on an object.
(De-allocating or garbage-collecting the object is not sufficient.)  For
example, the program must call \<close()> on every object that implements the
interface \<java.io.Closeable>.

The Resource Leak Checker can check any property of the form ``the programmer
must call each method in a set of methods \emph{M} at least once
on object \emph{O} before \emph{O} is de-allocated''.  For resource leaks,
by default \emph{M} is the set containing
\<close()> and \emph{O} is any object that implements the interface
\<java.io.Closeable>.  You can extend this guarantee to other types and methods
by writing \<@MustCall> or \<@InheritableMustCall> annotations, as described in
Section~\ref{must-call-annotations}.

The Resource Leak Checker works in three stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Must Call Checker (\chapterpageref{must-call-checker})
  over-approximates each expression's must-call methods as a
  \refqualclass{checker/mustcall/qual}{MustCall} type.
\item The Called Methods Checker (\chapterpageref{called-methods-checker})
  under-approximates each expression's definitely-called methods as a
  \refqualclass{checker/calledmethods/qual}{CalledMethods} type.
\item When any program element goes out of scope (i.e., it is ready to be
  de-allocated), the Resource Leak Checker compares the types
  \<@MustCall(\emph{MC})> and \<@CalledMethods(\emph{CM})>.  It reports an error
  if there exists some method in \emph{MC} that is not in \emph{CM}.
\end{enumerate}

gives more details about the Resource Leak Checker.


\sectionAndLabel{How to run the Resource Leak Checker}{resource-leak-run-checker}

Run one of these lines:

\begin{Verbatim}
javac -processor resourceleak MyFile.java ...
javac -processor org.checkerframework.checker.resourceleak.ResourceLeakChecker MyFile.java ...
\end{Verbatim}

The Resource Leak Checker supports all the command-line arguments
 listed in Section~\ref{called-methods-run-checker} for
the Called Methods Checker.

\sectionAndLabel{Resource Leak Checker annotations}{resource-leak-annotations}

The Resource Leak Checker relies on the type qualifiers of two other checkers:
the Must Call Checker (Section~\ref{must-call-annotations}) and
the Called Methods Checker (Section~\ref{called-methods-spec}). You might need
to write qualifiers from either type hierarchy. The most common annotations from
these checkers that you might need to write are:

\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclasswithparams{checker/mustcall/qual}{MustCall}{String[] value}]
for example on an element with compile-time type \<Object> that might contain a \<Socket>.
See Section~\ref{must-call-annotations}.

\item[\refqualclasswithparams{checker/mustcall/qual}{InheritableMustCall}{String[] value}]
on any classes defined in your program that have must-call obligations. See Section~\ref{must-call-on-class}.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/calledmethods/qual}{EnsuresCalledMethods}] on a method in
your code that fulfills a must-call obligation of one of its parameters or of a field.
See Section~\ref{called-methods-ensurescalledmethods}.

\end{description}

The Resource Leak Checker supports annotations that express
aliasing patterns related to resource leaks:

\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclass{checker/mustcall/qual}{Owning}]
\item[\refqualclass{checker/mustcall/qual}{NotOwning}]
  expresses ownership.  When two aliases exist to the same Java object,
  \<@Owning> and \<@NotOwning> indicate which of the two is responsible for
  fulfilling must-call obligations.  For details, see
  Section~\ref{resource-leak-ownership}.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/mustcall/qual}{MustCallAlias}]
  represents a ``resource-aliasing'' relationship.  Resource aliases are
  distinct Java objects that control the same resource(s):
  fulfilling the must-call obligations of one object also
  fulfills the obligations of the other object.  For details,
  see Section~\ref{resource-leak-resource-alias}.

\end{description}

The Resource Leak Checker also supports an annotation to permit re-assigning
fields or re-opening resources:

\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclasswithparams{checker/mustcall/qual}{CreatesMustCallFor}{String value}]
  is a declaration annotation that indicates that after a call to a method
  with this annotation none of the must-call obligations of the in-scope, owning expression
  listed in \<value> have been met.
  In other words, the annotated method ``resets'' the must-call obligations of the expression.
  Multiple \<@CreatesMustCallFor>
  annotations can be written on the same method.  For more details
  on how to use this annotation to permit re-assignment of owning
  fields or the re-opening of resources, see Section~\ref{resource-leak-createsmustcallfor}.

\end{description}


\sectionAndLabel{Example of how safe resource usage is verified}{resource-leak-example}

Consider the following example of safe use of a \<Socket>, in which the comments indicate the
inferred Must Call and Called Methods type qualifiers for \<s>:
\begin{verbatim}
{
  Socket s = null;
  // 1. @MustCall({}) @CalledMethodsBottom
  try {
    s = new Socket(myHost, myPort);
    // 2. @MustCall("close") @CalledMethods({})
  } catch (Exception e) {
    // do nothing
  } finally {
    if (s != null) {
      s.close();
      // 3. @MustCall("close") @CalledMethods("close")
    } else {
      // do nothing
      // 4. @MustCall("close") @CalledMethodsBottom
    }
    // 5. @MustCall("close") @CalledMethods("close")
  }
  // 6. @MustCall("close") @CalledMethods("close")
}
\end{verbatim}

At point 1, \<s>'s type qualifiers are the type qualifiers of \<null>:
\<null> has no must-call obligations (\<@MustCall(\{\})>),
and methods cannot be called on it (\<@CalledMethodsBottom>).

At point 2, \<s> is a new \<Socket> object, which
has a must-call obligation (\<@MustCall("close")>)
and has had no methods called on it (\<@CalledMethods(\{\})>).

At point 3, \<close()> has definitely been called on \<s>, so
\<s>'s Called Methods type is updated. Note that the Must Call type
does not change.

At point 4, \<s> is definitely \<null> and its type is adjusted accordingly.

At point 5, \<s>'s type is the least upper bound of the types at points 3
and 4.

At point 6, \<s> goes out of scope.  The Resource Leak Checker reports a
\<required.method.not.called> error if the Must Call set contains any
element that the Called Methods set does not.


\sectionAndLabel{Aliased references and ownership transfer}{resource-leak-ownership}

Resource leak checking is complicated by aliasing.  Multiple expressions
may evaluate to the same Java object, but each object only needs to be
closed once.  (Section~\ref{resource-leak-resource-alias} describes a
related situation called ``resource aliasing'', when multiple Java objects
refer to the same underlying resource.)

For example, consider the following code that safely closes a \<Socket>:

\begin{verbatim}
  void example(String myHost, int myPort) {
    Socket s = new Socket(myHost, myPort);
    closeSocket(s);
  }
  void closeSocket(@Owning @MustCall("close") Socket t) {
    t.close();
  }
\end{verbatim}

There are two aliases for a socket object: \<s> in \<example()> and \<t> in
\<closeSocket()>.  Ordinarily, the Resource Leak Checker requires that
\<close()> is called on every expression of type \<Socket>, but that is not
necessary here.  The Resource Leak Checker should not warn when
\<s> goes out of scope in \<example()>, because \<closeSocket()> takes ownership
of the socket --- that is, \<closeSocket()> takes responsibility for closing
it. The \<@Owning> annotation on \<t>'s declaration expresses this fact; it
tells the Resource Leak Checker that \<t> is the reference that must be
closed, and its alias \<s> need not be closed.

Constructor returns are always \<@Owning>.
Method returns default to \<@Owning>,
and parameters and fields default to \<@NotOwning>. This treatment of parameter and
return types ensures sound handling of unannotated third-party libraries: any
object returned from such a library will be tracked by default, and the checker
never assumes that passing an object to an unannotated library will satisfy its obligations.

\<@Owning> and \<@NotOwning> always \emph{transfer} must-call obligations: must-call
obligations are conserved (i.e., neither created nor destroyed) by ownership annotations.
Writing \<@Owning> or \<@NotOwning> can never make the checker
unsound:  a real warning can never be hidden by them.
As with any annotation, incorrect or missing annotations can lead to false positive warnings.


\subsectionAndLabel{Owning fields}{resource-leak-owning-fields}

Unannotated fields are treated as non-owning.

The Resource Leak Checker treats all \textbf{static fields} as non-owning, meaning that no assignment to one
can satisfy a must-call obligation.

For \textbf{final, non-static owning fields},
the Resource Leak Checker enforces the ``resource acquisition is
initialization (RAII)'' programming idiom.  Some
destructor-like method \<d()> must satisfy the field's must-call obligation
(and this fact must be expressed via a \<@EnsuresCalledMethods> annotation on \<d()>),
and the enclosing class must have a \<@MustCall("d")> obligation to
ensure the destructor is called.

\textbf{Non-final, non-static owning fields} usually require one or more \<@CreatesMustCallFor> annotations
when they might be re-assigned. See Section~\ref{resource-leak-createsmustcallfor} for
more details on how to annotate a non-final, non-static owning field.


\sectionAndLabel{Resource aliasing}{resource-leak-resource-alias}

A \emph{resource alias} set is a set of Java objects that
correspond to the same underlying system resource.
Calling a must-call method on any member of a resource-alias set
fulfills that obligation for all members of the set.
Members of the set may have different Java types.

Programmers most often encounter resource aliasing when using \emph{wrapper types}.
For example, the Java \<Buffered\-Output\-Stream> wrapper adds buffering to a
delegate stream.
The wrapper's \<close()> method invokes \<close()> on the delegate.  Calling
\<close()> on either object has the same effect:  it closes the underlying resource.

A resource aliasing relationship is expressed in source code via a pair of \<@MustCallAlias> annotations:
one on a parameter of a method or constructor, and another on its return type.
For example, the annotated JDK contains this constructor of \<BufferedOutputStream>:
\begin{Verbatim}
@MustCallAlias BufferedOutputStream(@MustCallAlias OutputStream out);
\end{Verbatim}

When a pair of \<@MustCallAlias> annotations is written on a method or constructor \<m>'s return type
and its parameter \<p>, the Resource Leak Checker requires one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \<p> is passed to another method or constructor (including \<super>) in a
  \<@MustCallAlias> position, and \<m> returns that method's result, or
\item \<p> is stored in an \<@Owning> field of the enclosing class.
\end{enumerate}


\sectionAndLabel{Creating obligations (how to re-assign a non-final owning field)}{resource-leak-createsmustcallfor}

Consider a class that has must-call obligations; that is, the class
declaration is annotated with \<@MustCall(...)>.
Every constructor implicitly creates obligations for the newly-created object.
Non-constructor methods may also create obligations
when re-assigning non-final owning fields or allocating
new system-level resources.

A post-condition annotation,
\<@CreatesMustCallFor>,
indicates for which expression an obligation is created.
If you write \<@CreatesMustCallFor(>\emph{T}\<)> on a method \emph{N} that
overrides a method \emph{M}, then \emph{M} must also be annotated as
\<@CreatesMustCallFor(>\emph{T}\<)>.  (\emph{M} may also have other
\<@CreatesMustCallFor> annotations that \emph{N} does not.)

\<@CreatesMustCallFor> allows the Resource Leak Checker to verify uses of non-final fields
that contain a resource, even if they are re-assigned. Consider
the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
  @MustCall("close") // default qualifier for uses of SocketContainer
  class SocketContainer {
    private @Owning Socket sock;

    public SocketContainer() { sock = ...; }

    void close() { sock.close() };

    @CreatesMustCallFor("this")
    void reconnect() {
      if (!sock.isClosed()) {
        sock.close();
      }
      sock = ...;
    }
  }
\end{verbatim}

In the lifetime of a \<SocketContainer> object, \<sock>
might be re-assigned arbitrarily many times: once at each
call to \<reconnect()>. This code is safe, however: \<reconnect()>
ensures that \<sock> is closed before re-assigning it.

Sections~\ref{resource-leak-createsmustcallfor-callsite}
and~\ref{resource-leak-createsmustcallfor-declaration}
explain how the Resource Leak Checker verifies uses and declarations of
methods annotated with \<@CreatesMustCallFor>.


\subsectionAndLabel{Requirements at a call site of a \<@CreatesMustCallFor> method}{resource-leak-createsmustcallfor-callsite}

At a call site to a method annotated as
\<@CreatesMustCallFor(>\emph{expr}\<)>, the Resource Leak Checker:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Treats any existing \<@MustCall> obligations of \emph{expr} as \emph{satisfied},
\item
  Creates a fresh obligation to check, as if \emph{expr} was assigned to a newly-allocated
  object (i.e. as if \emph{expr} were a constructor result).
\item
  Un-refines the type in the Called Methods Checker's type hierarchy for \emph{expr} to
  \<@CalledMethods(\{\})>, if it had any other Called Methods type.
\item
  Requires that the expression corresponding to \emph{expr} (that is, \emph{expr}
  viewpoint-adapted to the method call site) is owned; that is, it is
  annotated or defaulted as \<@Owning>.  Otherwise, the checker
  will issue a \<reset.not.owning> error at the call-site. You can avoid this
  error by extracting \emph{expr} into a new local variable (because
  locals are \<@Owning> by default) and replacing all instances of \emph{expr}
  in the call with references to the new local variable.
\end{enumerate}

Treating the obligation before the call as satisfied is sound: the
checker creates a new obligation for calls to \<@CreatesMustCallFor> methods,
and the Must Call Checker (\chapterpageref{must-call-checker}) ensures the
\<@MustCall> type for the target will have a \emph{superset} of any methods
present before the call. Intuitively, calling an \<@CreatesMustCallFor> method
``resets'' the obligations of the target, so whether they were satisfied before
the call or not is irrelevant.

If an \<@CreatesMustCallFor>
method \emph{n} is invoked within a method \emph{m} that has an \<@CreatesMustCallFor> annotation,
and the \<@CreatesMustCallFor> annotations on \emph{n} and \emph{m} have
the same target---imposing the obligation produced by calling \emph{n} on the caller of \emph{m}---then
the newly-created obligation is treated as satisfied immediately
at the call-site of \emph{n} in the body of \emph{m} (because it is imposed at call-sites of \emph{m}
instead).


\subsectionAndLabel{Requirements at a declaration of a \<@CreatesMustCallFor> method}{resource-leak-createsmustcallfor-declaration}

Any method that re-assigns a non-final, owning field of some object \<obj>
must be annotated \<@CreatesMustCallFor("obj")>.
Other methods may also be annotated with \<@CreatesMustCallFor>.

The Resource Leak Checker enforces two rules to ensure that re-assignments
to non-final, owning fields (like \<sock> in method \<reconnect> above) are
sound:
\begin{itemize}
\item any method that re-assigns a non-final, owning field of an object
  must be annotated with a \<@CreatesMustCallFor> annotation
  that targets that object.
\item when a non-final, owning field $f$ is re-assigned at statement $s$,
  at the program point before $s$, $f$'s must-call obligations must have been satisfied.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
The first rule ensures that \<close()> is called after the last call
to \<reconnect()>, and the second rule ensures that \<reconnect()>
safely closes \<sock> before re-assigning it. Because the Called Methods Checker
treats calls to an \<@CreatesMustCallFor> method like \<reconnect()> as if the call might
cause arbitrary side-effects, after such a call the only method known to have been
definitely called is the \<@CreatesMustCallFor> method: previous called
methods (including \<close()>) do not appear in the \<@CalledMethods> type qualifier.
