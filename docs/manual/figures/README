This directory contains the SVG files used for the diagrams in the Checker
Framework manual.  The HTML manual uses the SVGs directly.  The PDF manual
uses PDF conversions of each SVG.

SVG can be edited using a variety of tools, such as Inkscape, Visio, and
LibreOffice/OpenOffice.

https://www.draw.io is a good tool for easily editing these figures, but
the svg files it exports don't convert to pdf with correct formatting if
they have multiline text, and the figures might require fine tuning with
inkscape afterwards.

To create a new image, please copy an existing SVG and make modifications
to it, so that the boxes and arrows you create have the same size and font
as in other SVGs.


To include an image in your chapter, use for example:

\includeimage{formatter-hierarchy}{3.5cm}
or
\includeimagenocentering{value-subtyping}{2.75cm}

Note the absence of the SVG extension. Note that the size parameter is the
*vertical* size for the PDF only, not the HTML.  To affect the size of an
image in HTML, please edit the image size in the SVG directly.
