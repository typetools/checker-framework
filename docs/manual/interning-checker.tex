\chapterAndLabel{Interning Checker}{interning-checker}

If the Interning Checker issues no errors for a given program, then all
reference equality tests (i.e., all uses of ``\code{==}'') are proper;
that is,
\code{==} is not misused where \code{equals()} should have been used instead.

Interning is a design pattern in which the same object is used whenever two
different objects would be considered equal.  Interning is also known as
canonicalization or hash-consing, and it is related to the flyweight design
pattern.
Interning has two benefits:  it can save memory, and it can speed up testing for
equality by permitting use of \code{==}.

The Interning Checker prevents two types of errors in your code.  First,
\code{==} should be used
only on interned values; using \code{==} on
non-interned values can result in subtle bugs.  For example:

\begin{Verbatim}
  Integer x = new Integer(22);
  Integer y = new Integer(22);
  System.out.println(x == y);  // prints false!
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The Interning Checker helps programmers to prevent such bugs.
Second,
the Interning Checker also helps to prevent performance problems that result
from failure to use interning.
(See Section~\ref{checker-guarantees} for caveats to the checker's guarantees.)

Interning is such an important design pattern that Java builds it in for
these types: \<String>, \<Boolean>, \<Byte>, \<Character>, \<Integer>,
\<Short>.  Every string literal in the program is guaranteed to be interned
(\href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se10/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.10.5}{JLS
  \S3.10.5}), and the
\sunjavadoc{java/lang/String.html\#intern--}{String.intern()} method
performs interning for strings that are computed at run time.
The \<valueOf> methods in wrapper classes always (\<Boolean>, \<Byte>) or
sometimes (\<Character>, \<Integer>, \<Short>) return an interned result
(\href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se10/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.7}{JLS \S5.1.7}).
Users can also write their own interning methods for other types.

It is a proper optimization to use \code{==}, rather than \code{equals()},
whenever the comparison is guaranteed to produce the same result --- that
is, whenever the comparison is never provided with two different objects
for which \code{equals()} would return true.  Here are three reasons that
this property could hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Interning.  A factory method ensures that, globally, no two different
  interned objects are \code{equals()} to one another.
  (Not every value of the given type is necessarily interned; it is
  possible for two objects of the class to be
  \code{equals()} to one another, even if one of them is interned.)
  Interned objects should always be immutable.
\item
  Global control flow.  The program's control flow is such that the
  constructor for class $C$ is called a limited number of times, and with
  specific values that ensure the results are not \code{equals()} to one
  another.  Objects of class $C$ can always be compared with \code{==}.
  Such objects may be mutable or immutable.
\item
  Local control flow.  Even though not all objects of the given type may be
  compared with \code{==}, the specific objects that can reach a given
  comparison may be.  For example, suppose that an array contains no
  duplicates.  Then searching for the index of an element that is
  known to be in the array can use \code{==}.
\end{enumerate}

To eliminate Interning Checker errors, you will need to annotate the
declarations of any expression used as an argument to \code{==}.
Thus, the Interning Checker
could also have been called the Reference Equality Checker.
% In the
% future, the checker will include annotations that target the non-interning
% cases above, but for now you need to use \<@Interned>, \<@UsesObjectEquals>
% (which handles a surprising number of cases), and/or
% \<@SuppressWarnings>.

\begin{sloppypar}
To run the Interning Checker, supply the
\code{-processor org.checkerframework.checker.interning.InterningChecker}
command-line option to javac.  For examples, see Section~\ref{interning-example}.
\end{sloppypar}


\sectionAndLabel{Interning annotations}{interning-annotations}

These qualifiers are part of the Interning type system:

\begin{description}

\item[\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned}]
  indicates a type that includes only interned values (no non-interned
  values).

\item[\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{InternedDistinct}]
  indicates a type such that each value is not \<equals()> to any other
  Java value.  For details, see Section~\ref{interning-distinct}.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{UnknownInterned}]
  indicates a type whose values might or might not be interned.
  It is used internally by the type system and is not written by programmers.

\item[\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{PolyInterned}]
  indicates qualifier polymorphism (see
  Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism}).

\item[\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{UsesObjectEquals}]
  is a class annotation (not a type annotation) that indicates that this class's
  \<equals> method is the same as that of \<Object>.  In other words,
  neither this class nor any of its superclasses overrides the \<equals>
  method.  Since \<Object.equals> uses reference equality, this means that
  for such a class, \<==> and \<equals> are equivalent, and so the
  Interning Checker does not issue errors or warnings for either one.

\end{description}


\sectionAndLabel{Annotating your code with \code{@Interned}}{interning-annotating}

\begin{figure}
\includeimage{interning}{2.5cm}
\caption{Type hierarchy for the Interning type system.}
\label{fig-interning-hierarchy}
\end{figure}

In order to perform checking, you must annotate your code with the \refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned}
type annotation.  A type annotated with \<@Interned> contains the canonical
representation of an
object:

%BEGIN LATEX
\begin{smaller}
%END LATEX
\begin{Verbatim}
            String s1 = ...;  // type is (uninterned) "String"
  @Interned String s2 = ...;  // type is "@Interned String"
\end{Verbatim}
%BEGIN LATEX
\end{smaller}
%END LATEX

The Interning Checker ensures that only interned
values can be assigned to \code{s2}.

To specify that \emph{all} objects of a given type are interned, annotate the
class declaration:

\begin{Verbatim}
  public @Interned class MyInternedClass { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

This makes every use of \code{MyInternedClass}, in a
declaration or elsewhere, implicitly \<@Interned>.


\subsectionAndLabel{Implicit qualifiers}{interning-implicit-qualifiers}

The Interning Checker
adds implicit qualifiers, reducing the number of annotations that must
appear in your code (see Section~\ref{effective-qualifier}).
For example, String literals and the \<null> literal are always considered interned, and
object creation expressions (using \code{new}) are never considered
\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned} unless they are annotated as such, as in

%BEGIN LATEX
\begin{smaller}
%END LATEX
\begin{Verbatim}
@Interned Double internedDoubleZero = new @Interned Double(0); // canonical representation for Double zero
\end{Verbatim}
%BEGIN LATEX
\end{smaller}
%END LATEX

For a complete description of all implicit interning qualifiers, see the
Javadoc for \refclass{checker/interning}{InterningAnnotatedTypeFactory}.


\subsectionAndLabel{InternedDistinct: values not equals() to any other value}{interning-distinct}

The \refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{InternedDistinct} annotation
represents values that are not \<equals()> to any other value.  Suppose
expression \<e> has type \<@InternedDistinct>.  Then \<e.equals(x) == (e ==
x)>.  Therefore, it is legal to use \<==> whenever at least one of the
operands has type \<@InternedDistinct>.

\<@InternedDistinct> is stronger (more restrictive) than \<@Interned>.
For example, consider these variables:

\begin{Verbatim}
@Interned String i = "22";
          String s = new Integer(22).toString();
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The variable \<i> is not \<@InternedDistinct> because \<i.equals(s)> is true.

\<@InternedDistinct> is not as restrictive as stating that all objects of a
given Java type are interned.

The \<@InternedDistinct> annotation is rarely used, because it arises from
coding paradigms that are tricky to reason about.
%
One use is on static fields
that hold canonical values of a type.
Given this declaration:

\begin{Verbatim}
class MyType {
  final static @InternedDistinct MyType SPECIAL = new MyType(...);
  ...
}
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
it would be legal to write \<myValue == MyType.SPECIAL> rather than
\<myValue.equals(MyType.SPECIAL)>.

The \<@InternedDistinct> is trusted (not verified), because it would be too
complex to analyze the \<equals()> method to ensure that no other value is
\<equals()> to a \<@InternedDistinct> value.  You will need to manually
verify that it is only written in locations where its contract is satisfied.
For example, here is one set of guidelines that you could check manually:
\begin{itemize}
\item The constructor is private.
\item The factory method returns the canonical version for certain values.
\item The class is final, so that subclasses cannot violate these properties.
\end{itemize}


\sectionAndLabel{What the Interning Checker checks}{interning-checks}

Objects of an \refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned} type may be safely compared using the ``\code{==}''
operator.

The checker issues an error in two cases:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  When a reference (in)equality operator (``\code{==}'' or ``\code{!=}'')
  has an operand of non-\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned} type.
  As a special case, the operation is permitted if either argument is of
  \refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{InternedDistinct} type

\item
  When a non-\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned} type is used
  where an \refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned} type
  is expected.

\end{enumerate}

This example shows both sorts of problems:

\begin{Verbatim}
                    Date  date;
          @Interned Date idate;
  @InternedDistinct Date ddate;
  ...
  if (date == idate) ...  // error: reference equality test is unsafe
  idate = date;           // error: idate's referent might no longer be interned
  ddate = idate;          // error: idate's referent might be equals() to some other value
\end{Verbatim}

\label{lint-dotequals}

The checker also issues a warning when \code{.equals} is used where
\code{==} could be safely used.  You can disable this behavior via the
javac \code{-Alint=-dotequals} command-line option.

For a complete description of all checks performed by
  the checker, see the Javadoc for
  \refclass{checker/interning}{InterningVisitor}.

\label{checking-class}
You can also restrict which types the checker should examine and type-check,
using the \code{-Acheckclass} option.  For example, to find only the
interning errors related to uses of \code{String}, you can pass
\code{-Acheckclass=java.lang.String}.  The Interning Checker always checks all
subclasses and superclasses of the given class.


\subsectionAndLabel{Limitations of the Interning Checker}{interning-limitations}

% There is no point to linking to the Javadoc for the valueOf methods,
% which don't discuss interning.

The Interning Checker conservatively assumes that the \<Character>, \<Integer>,
and \<Short> \<valueOf> methods return a non-interned value.  In fact, these
methods sometimes return an interned value and sometimes a non-interned
value, depending on the run-time argument (\href{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se10/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.7}{JLS
\S5.1.7}).  If you know that the run-time argument to \<valueOf> implies that
the result is interned, then you will need to suppress an error.
(The Interning Checker should make use of the Value Checker to estimate the upper
and lower bounds on char, int, and short values so that it can more
precisely determine whether the result of a given \<valueOf> call is
interned.)



\sectionAndLabel{Examples}{interning-example}

To try the Interning Checker on a source file that uses the \refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned} qualifier,
use the following command:

\begin{mysmall}
\begin{Verbatim}
  javac -processor org.checkerframework.checker.interning.InterningChecker docs/examples/InterningExample.java
\end{Verbatim}
\end{mysmall}

\noindent
Compilation will complete without errors or warnings.

To see the checker warn about incorrect usage of annotations, use the following
command:

\begin{mysmall}
\begin{Verbatim}
  javac -processor org.checkerframework.checker.interning.InterningChecker docs/examples/InterningExampleWithWarnings.java
\end{Verbatim}
\end{mysmall}

\noindent
The compiler will issue an error regarding violation of the semantics of
\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned}.
% in the \code{InterningExampleWithWarnings.java} file.


The Daikon invariant detector
(\myurl{http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/}) is also annotated with
\refqualclass{checker/interning/qual}{Interned}.  From directory \code{java/},
run \code{make check-interning}.



\sectionAndLabel{Other interning annotations}{other-interning-annotations}

The Checker Framework's interning annotations are similar to annotations used
elsewhere.

If your code is already annotated with a different interning
annotation, the Checker Framework can type-check your code.
It treats annotations from other tools
as if you had written the corresponding annotation from the
Interning Checker, as described in Figure~\ref{fig-interning-refactoring}.
If the other annotation is a declaration annotation, it may be moved; see
Section~\ref{declaration-annotations-moved}.
