This directory contains an example Maven project that downloads the latest
Checker Framework Maven artifacts and runs the Nullness Checker.
The project assumes you are using a Java 8 compiler.  If you are using
a Java 7 compiler, modify the pom.xml by following the instructions in
the three locations in the pom.xml that mention "if using Java 7".

To run the example, simply execute:
mvn compile

You should see output that includes:

MavenExample.java:[26,29] error: [assignment.type.incompatible] incompatible types in assignment.
