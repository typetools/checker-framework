The graphs in './graphs' have been generated by running the Checker Framework on
the Java files (using the '-Aflowdotdir=dir' commmand-line option) and then
running Graphviz on the output (e.g. using 'dot -Tpdf -o file.pdf file.dot').

TODO: How to include only the CFG, without stores and values?
TODO: The macro that includes these PDFs uses a fixed scale. What is the
recommended PDF width?
