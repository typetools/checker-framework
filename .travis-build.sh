# Skip the manual because it cannot be compiled on Ubuntu 12.04.
# make -C checker/manual all

## Tests
# The JDK was built above; there is no need to rebuild it again.
# Don't use "-d" to debug ant, because that results in a log so long
# that Travis truncates the log and terminates the job.
## Alternative 1 (desired alternative):
# ant tests-nobuildjdk
# (cd checker && ant check-compilermsgs check-purity)
## Alternative 2 (because alternative 1 currently crashes);
## just run tests that Travis doesn't crash on.
## Eventually, we will remove this alternative from the file.
# Run framework tests.
(cd framework && ant all-tests-nojtreg-nobuild)
# Subset of all-tests
# Also runs framework jtreg-tests
(cd checker && ant jtreg-tests)
(cd checker && ant command-line-tests)
(cd checker && ant example-tests-nobuildjdk)
(cd checker && ant check-tutorial)
# If too many checker tests are run, the tests crash, so run one.
(cd checker && ant nullness-base-tests regex-qual-tests lock-tests lock-safedefaults-tests)
## end of alternatives.

# It's cheaper to run the demos test here than to trigger the
# checker-framework-demos job, which has to build the whole Checker Framework.
