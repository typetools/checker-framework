Checker Framework Maven plugin developer manual

This document is intended for people who want to use a custom version of
the Checker Framework together with Maven, or who wish to work on the Maven
plugin itself.  If you just wish to use the Checker Framework Maven plugin
then you should follow the directions in the Checker Framework manual (see
http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#maven-plugin).

Ordinarily, the Maven plugin loads artifacts such as the Checker Framework
from the repository http://types.cs.washington.edu/m2-repo .  You may wish
to load your own version of the artifacts.
 * If you have your own modified version of the Checker Framework (say, it
   adds a new type-checker or fixes a bug), then follow the instructions for
   "Using a custom artifact, such as checkers.jar".
 * If you have modified the Maven plugin itself, then follow the instructions
   for "Installing the Maven plugin locally".



Dependencies
============

The plugin depends on 5 Maven artifacts.  If the artifacts aren't present
when executing Maven, then the plugin will attempt to download them.

Remember that a Maven artifact is uniquely identified by its group id,
artifact name, and version.

The artifacts have a shared group id of "org.checkerframework".

The artifact names are:
  checkerframework-maven-plugin - the Checker Framework maven plugin itself
  checker-qual - checkers-qual.jar
  compiler - jsr308-langtools compiler's javac.jar
  framework - checkers.jar
  jdk7 - jdk7.jar

The version number is specified by the checkerFrameworkVersion element in your
pom.xml or, if the checkerFrameworkVersion element is missing, is the version of
your Maven plugin.  See
http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#maven-plugin.



Using a custom artifact, such as checkers.jar
=============================================

You may wish to test a modified version of checkers.jar or another artifact
with the Checker Framework Maven plugin.  To do so, you will install the
artifacts with a new version number.  (You do not have to install the Maven
plugin locally, though.)  Follow these instructions:

1.  Increment the version number in the poms found in
checkerframework/maven-plugin/poms.  (Try to choose a change, like adding ".001" at the
very end, that is unlikely to be the next version that the Checker
Framework developers choose.)  Make sure that the new version numbers all
agree.

2.  Run:
  sh checkerframework/maven-plugin/poms/localInstall.sh
This command installs all of the jars in checkerframework/checker/dist as artifacts in
your "local repository" (the local cache of downloaded artifacts) using the
version number found in the corresponding pom file in checkerframework/maven-plugin/poms.

3.  For the project on which you are applying the Checker Framework, make
sure the element "checkerFrameworkVersion" matches the version created in step 1.

You can now run
  mvn checkers:check
on the project you wish to type-check and it will use your custom version
of the Maven plugin or any custom version of the dependencies that you have
installed.



Installing the Maven plugin locally
===================================

The following simple commands allow you to build the plugin, install it
locally, and install it to a repository.

1. Update the Maven plugin version number in
checkerframework/maven-plugin/pom.xml.  (Try to choose a change, like adding
".001" at the very end, that is unlikely to be the next version that the
Checker Framework developers choose.)

2. Build the plugin:

mvn clean package

3. Install the locally-built plugin:

mvn install

4. In the project that you are type-checking, update the Checker Framework
plugin section of the pom to match the version number created in step 1.



Notes
=====

The version numbers of the various pom files are automatically updated by
the Checker Framework release scripts.

If you are using Maven 3, then adding -U to any command will force Maven to
overwrite any existing dependencies with newly downloaded dependencies.
This can be useful when debugging a deployed plugin for which you don't
want to increase its version number.

At times, you may wish to deploy a version of the plugin to a repository
other than the Checker Framework respository.  This is useful to share a
development version of the plugin or for testing purposes.  To deploy an
artifact to the location //<your path>/maven/m2-repo, use the following
command (use a different -Dfile argument to deploy a different artifact; see
checkers/binary/poms/localInstall.sh for example -Dfile arguments).

    mvn deploy:deploy-file \
    -DartifactId=checkersplugin \
    -Dfile=checkerframework/maven-plugin/target/checkers-maven-plugin-<latest-version>.jar \
    -Dversion=<latest-version> \
    -Durl=file://<your path>/maven/m2-repo \
    -DgroupId=org.checkerframework \
    -Dpackaging=jar \
    -DpomFile=checkerframework/maven-plugin/pom.xml \
    -DgeneratePom=false 

Note that the url property must start with a protocol such as "file://".
