Thank you for contributing to the Checker Framework!  This project is a
community effort of [more than 110

more people who have contributed bug reports and feature suggestions.  We
couldn't do it without your help.


## Reporting bugs

Please see the [bug
reporting](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#reporting-bugs) section of

If the documentation is incorrect, incomplete, or confusing, that is a
bug, and we want to fix it.  Please report it.

Do you want to contribute to the project, but you are not sure what issue
to fix or what feature to add?  Use the tool in your daily work, and when
you encounter a limitation that bothers you, fix that one.  The ["help
wanted"](https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
label marks issues that require less deep knowledge and may be appropriate
for a newcomer to the codebase.
