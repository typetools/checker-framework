couldn't do it without your help.

Do you want to contribute to the project, but you are not sure what issue
to fix or what feature to add?  Use the tool in your daily work, and when
you encounter a limitation that bothers you, fix that one.  The ["help
wanted"](https://github.com/eisop/checker-framework/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
