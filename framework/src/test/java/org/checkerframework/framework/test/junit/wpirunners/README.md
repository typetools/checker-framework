This package contains the test runners for testing whole-program inference.
They are in a separate package so that they don't run by default; they should
only run when they're invoked directly by their corresponding build rules, which
are in framework/build.gradle (wholeProgramInferenceTest and wholeProgramInferenceStubsTest).
