/**
 * An expression with this type is exactly the same as an {@link IntRange} annotation whose {@code
 * from} field is {@code 1} and whose {@code to} field is {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE}. However, this
 * annotation is derived from an {@code org.checkerframework.checker.index.qual.Positive}
 * annotation.
 *
 * <p>IntRangeFromPositive annotations derived from Positive annotations are used to create IntRange
 * annotations, but IntRangeFromPositive annotations are not checked when they appear on the left
 * hand side of expressions. Therefore, the Index Checker MUST be run on any code with @Positive
 * annotations on the left-hand side of expressions, since the Value Checker will derive information
 * from them but not check them.
 *
 * <p>It is an error to write this annotation directly. {@code @Positive} or {@code IntRange(from =
 * 1, to = Integer.MAX_VALUE)} should always be written instead. This annotation is not retained in
 * bytecode, but is replaced with {@code @UnknownVal}, so that it is not enforced on method
 * boundaries. The {@code @Positive} annotation it replaced is retained in bytecode by the Lower
 * Bound Checker instead.
