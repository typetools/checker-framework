/**
 * Indicates that this class has been annotated for the given type system.
 * For example, <code>@AnnotatedFor({"nullness", "regex"})</code> indicates
 * that the class has been annotated with annotations such as
 * <tt>@Nullable</tt> and <tt>@Regex</tt>.
 * <p>
 *
 * Ordinarily, the <tt>-AuseConservativeDefaultsForUnannotatedSourceCode</tt> command-line argument
 * causes unannotated locations to be defaulted using conservative library
 * annotations, and it suppresses all warnings.  The
 * <tt>-AuseConservativeDefaultsForUnannotatedSourceCode</tt> command-line argument has no effect on
 * classes with a relevant <tt>@AnnotatedFor</tt> annotation:  any
 * unannotated location is defaulted normally (typically using the
 * CLIMB-to-top rule), and typechecking warnings are issued.
 * <p>
 *
 * <code>@AnnotatedFor</code>'s arguments are any string that may be passed
 * to the <tt>-processor</tt> command-line argument:  the fully-qualified
 * class name for the checker, or a shorthand for built-in checkers.  Using
 * the annotation with no arguments, as in
 * <code>@AnnotatedFor({})</code>, has no effect.
