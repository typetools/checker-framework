/**
 * Declares that the field may not be accessed if the receiver is of the
 * specified qualifier type (or any supertype).
 * <p>
 *
 * This property is verified by the checker that type-checks the {@code
 * when} element value qualifier.
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b>
 * Consider a class, {@code Table}, with a locking field, {@code lock}.  The
 * lock is used when a {@code Table} instance is shared across threads.  When
 * running in a local thread, the {@code lock} field ought not to be used.
 * <p>
 *
 * You can declare this behavior in the following way:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class Table {
 *   private @Unused(when=LocalToThread.class) final Lock lock;
 *   ...
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * The checker for {@code @LocalToThread} would issue an error for the following code:
 *
 * <pre>  @LocalToThread Table table = ...;
 *   ... table.lock ...;
 * </pre>
 *
