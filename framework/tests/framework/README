Java files in this directory are allowed to contain Java errors
(that is, to cause javac without a processor to issue an error).
This is an exception to the rules in ../../../checker/tests/README .

To run the tests, do
  ant -e -find build.xml framework-tests

To run a single test, do something like:
  cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/framework/tests/framework
  (cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && ant -e dist) && (cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/framework && ant build-tests) && javac -processor TestChecker -classpath $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/framework/tests/build GenericTest10.java
