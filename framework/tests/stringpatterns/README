To add a new file to the test suite, see
  ../README

To run the tests, do
  ant -e -find build.xml stringpattern-tests

See target "stringpattern-tests" in file ../../build.xml for details.

These cannot be in the same directory as subtyping-tests because some of the
expected errors in that directory are specific to the Encrypted type system.
