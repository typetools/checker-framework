This directory contains test cases for all type systems.
As they are meant for all type systems, they do not contain any
actual annotations or expected errors.
They exercise tricky Java coding patterns that should be handled
correctly.

If a new type system correctly issues an error or a warning for one of these
tests, then suppress it using the most specific SuppressWarnings string
possible, for example "keyfor:return.type.incompatible".  Write the
@SuppressWarnings annotation such that the scope is as limited as possible, but
do not alter the code.  Write a comment on the warning suppression explaining
why the error is expected. Add the test with the expected error to the type
systems test and add the expected error and/or adding annotations to prevent the
error to the test.

TODO: move interesting general purpose test cases from specific
type systems to this directory.
