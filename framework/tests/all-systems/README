This directory contains test cases for all type systems.
As they are meant for all type systems, they do not contain any expected errors.
They exercise tricky Java coding patterns that should be handled
correctly.

If a new type system correctly issues an error or a warning for one of these
tests, then you can either add annotations to fix the error or suppress the
warning.  In either case, do not alter the code itself. Rewriting the code
may cause the test to no longer test the specific syntax intended to.

If suppressing the warning, use the most specific SuppressWarnings string
possible, for example "keyfor:return".  Write the @SuppressWarnings
annotation such that the scope is as limited as possible, but do not alter
the code.  Write a comment on the warning suppression explaining why the
error is expected.  Also add the test to the test suite for the specific
checker, because the all-systems tests should not be the only place that a
feature is tested.
