This directory contains test cases for all type systems.
As they are meant for all type systems, they do not contain any expected errors.
They exercise tricky Java coding patterns that should be handled
correctly.

If a new type system correctly issues an error or a warning for one of these
tests, then you can either suppress the warning or add annotations to fix the error. In either case,
only add annotations without otherwise altering the code. Rewriting the code may cause the test to no
longer test the specific syntax intented to. If suppressing the warning, the use the
most specific SuppressWarnings string possible, for example "keyfor:return".  Write the
@SuppressWarnings annotation such that the scope is as limited as possible, but
do not alter the code.  Write a comment on the warning suppression explaining
why the error is expected. Add the test with the expected error to the type
systems test and add the expected error and/or adding annotations to prevent the
error to the test.
