    This document explains how to build and release the Eclipse plugin for the Checker Framework.
    It is easiest to perform these steps on your local machine rather than on a server such as buffalo.
    However one must take special care to keep one's local Checker Framework repository's Eclipse
    directory clean.
    In general the process consists of 7 steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Copy Checker Framework artifacts to the plugin's lib directory.</li>
    <li>Update the version numbers of the plugin.</li>
    <li>Check to make sure all checkers from the Checker Framework manual are included in the plugin.</li>
    <li>Build the plugin.</li>
    <li>Install and test the plugin locally.</li>
    <li>Copy the release to the deployment directory.</li>
    <li>Update symlinks to point to the latest plugin release.</li>
    <li>After the Checker Framework release process is complete, push the files
    with version number changes from your local repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    This document also contains sections with development tips and possible future improvements.
</p>
<p>
    After becoming familiar with the build process, building and deploying the plugin should take ~20 minutes.

    <h2>Pre-build Checklist</h2>
    <p>If you have not built the Eclipse plugin before, please follow these steps:</p>
    <table class="table">

            <td>1.</td>
            <td><strong>Download a copy of Eclipse with RCP Support</strong><br/>
                On Ubuntu, run <code>sudo apt-get install eclipse-rcp eclipse-platform</code><br    />
                or Visit:<br/>
                <code>http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</code><br/>
                Download and install the latest copy of "Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers".  You will probably
                want to "Check for Updates" in Eclipse after installing though it is not strictly necessary.

            <td><strong>Import the Checker Framework project in Eclipse</strong><br/>
                The Checker Framework manual has instructions on building the Checker Framework from source:<br/>
                <code>http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#build-source</code>
                <br/>
                You do not need to build the framework but you do need the Checker Framework source.  Use a local clone
                of the Checker Framework and import that project into a workspace.
                You only need to import the directories under checker-framework/eclipse since the Eclipse plugin uses
                prepackaged Checker Framework jars.
                <br/> <br/>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open Eclipse with RCP Support</li>
                    <li>Select File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace</li>
                    <li>Select the <code>checker-framework/eclipse</code> directory from your Checker Framework clone</li>
                    <li>Select all three projects and import</li>
                    <li>If these projects were ever built on your machine before, make sure to "Clean all projects" and
                        then manually verify that the project directories have no extraneous files.</li>

                we typically test on fresh Eclipse installations.  It is recommended that you keep
                a fresh install of Eclipse in a directory that stays untouched, and make a copy of
                that directory each time.  See the <a href="#testing">Testing the Plugin</a>

        This section is directed to developers of the Eclipse plugin.  If you are merely releasing the Eclipse

    serves a distinct purpose, outline below.

                        There are two versions in site.xml that need to be updated.  It is easier to just update the

                        the previous versions (in the &lt;feature&gt; tag) to the same version as in the above

                <strong>Build Step 2: Update the list of checkers</strong><br/>
                Note, if you have already built the plugin, the quickest way to check the list of checkers is to:

                <ol>
                    <li>Open an Eclipse instance with the plugin installed.</li>
                    <li>Right click a folder or source file.</li>
                    <li>Select &quot;Run built-in checker&quot;.</li>

                        Checker Framework manual. (The Map Key Checker is listed in the introduction, but is not in the plugin.)</li>
                </ol>
                Alternatively, you can verify the list of checkers using the following process.
                When adding a new checker, ensure that it is in the same relative order
                to other checkers as the order in the manual's table of contents.  For consistency,
                please do this even in code where the order is not visible to the user - this will
                make it easier for the lists to be verified periodically.

                <ol>
                    <li>In your Eclipse with RCP IDE, open the plugin.xml editor.</li>
                    <li>Select the plugin.xml tab.</li>
                    <li>Search for <strong>commandId=&quot;checkers.eclipse.runnullness&quot;</strong>.</li>

                        an entry in the command list that you found using the previous search.</li>
                    <li>Search for <strong>defaultHandler=&quot;org.checkerframework.eclipse.actions.CheckerActions$NullnessAction&quot;</strong>.</li>
                    <li>For each command, ensure there is a corresponding handler in the list found
                        by the previous search.

                with compilation errors, Eclipse (frustratingly) places the error messages in a text file,
                in a directory that's in a zip file "logs.zip" in the Update site directory.
                If the build fails for other reason (such as forgetting to update one of the versions),
                most often no error is reported but no files are created.  In this case, it's as if the button did
                nothing.  Sometimes errors can be found in the "Problems" or "Errors" view of Eclipse.
                If the plug-in jar fails to be updated under checker-framework-eclipse-update-site/plugins, try
                deleting artifacts.jar and content.jar in the checker-framework-eclipse-update-site directory
                and rebuilding.

    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>To test your plugin, you should install it locally.  You can find installation instructions at:<br/>
       <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/eclipse/">http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/eclipse/</a><br/>
       However, when installing the plugin, rather than using the above URL for the location of the
       plugin, you should press the "Local" button and select the directory of your
       checker-framework-update-site project.  The IDE will treat that directory as an update site
       and, providing you have built the plugin, install the plugin from there.<br/><br/>

       For basic testing, you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open a workspace containing any of the Checker Framework example or test files</li>
        <li>Open the Checker Preferences page and select "Show verbose output"</li>
        <li>Run any checker from Eclipse</li>
        <li>Ensure that all expected error messages are output to the console (Window->Show View->Console)</li>
        <li>Ensure that for each error output to the console, the corresponding line of code has a
            warning or error marker in the editor's margin.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When performing a release, you should test the "Getting Started" and "Validating User Input" guides from
    the checker framework tutorial: <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/tutorial/">
        http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/tutorial/</a>

    <div class="alert alert-warning">
        In the next section we discuss a typical workflow for testing the Eclipse plugin.  This workflow
        is not ideal and could be better served by using Eclipse to debug the plugin.  Debugging, however,
        has a number of problems (see <a href="#debugging">Debugging</a>).  An intrepid developer might
        spend some time figuring out a better manner of debugging and updating this document accordingly.
    </div>
    <h4>Iterative Development and Version Numbers</h4>
    <p>
        Much development is done iteratively.  If you have previously installed a plugin locally, you
        will not be able to update it without first updating the plugin's versions.  At the moment, we have no
        scripts to do this automatically.  The locations you should do this for are:
        <ul>
            <li>checker-framework-eclipse-feature/feature.xml - on the &quot;Overview&quot; and
                &quot;Plug-ins&quot; tabs</li>
            <li>checker-framework-eclipse-plugin/plugin.xml - on the &quot;Overview&quot; tab</li>
            <li>checker-framework-eclipse-update-site/site.xml - on the &quot;site.xml&quot; tab</li>
        </ul>

        When updating the versions, Eclipse will recognize version numbers with integers out to 4 places.
        Therefore, a typical workflow might be to:
        <ul>
            <li>Build the plugin</li>
            <li>Install the plugin in a freshly installed copy of Eclipse</li>
            <li>While there are still bugs in the plugin
                <ul>
                    <li>Increment the version number by 0.0.0.1, e.g.,
                        <ul>
                            <li>1.8.0.1 would become 1.8.0.2</li>
                            <li>1.7.9.8 would become 1.8.0</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Rebuild the plugin</li>
                    <li>In your previously installed copy of Eclipse, update the plugin via:
                        Help->Check For Updates*
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Delete the copy of Eclipse installed for testing</li>
        </ul>

        We suggest installing a fresh copy of Eclipse because Eclipse tries to cache everything possible.  Even
        if you told Eclipse to uninstall a plugin, it will unlink it in the user interface but keep that plugin
        around.  If you then try to reinstall the plugin, it will just link the previously downloaded plugin back
        into the UI.

        <div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>*Note:</strong> Eclipse will only ever check for updates
            once per execution of the editor.  Therefore, between successive updates to the Eclipse plugin
            you should restart Eclipse (File->Restart).<br/>
        </div>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <strong>*Note:</strong> When you select "Check for Updates", the Eclipse plugin will check for
            updates for the entire Eclipse platform.  This is why we suggest downloading the version of
            Eclipse you would like to test on, checking for updates before ever installing a plugin,
            zipping that version up for later use.  Whenever you need a fresh copy of Eclipse, you can
            then just unzip your updated copy and you'll avoid long waits when checking for updates.

<section id="debugging">
    <h2>Debugging</h2>

    <p> This section gives an outline of the steps needed to debug the Eclipse plugin.
        There is, however, there are issues that make debugging difficult and less useful.
        The plugin requires all the jars in the lib directory to be on the class path.  If the plugin is
        installed via an update-site then the plugin jar will be extracted into the plugins directory.
        Unfortunately, this leads to a slightly different directory layout then the project directory
        (the bin/classes/checker dir becomes a top level dir).  This means that the classpath used when
        the plugin is run as an actual plugin is different then the one needed to run debug plugin from the
        eclipse project.  So (for now anyways), you must copy the bin/classes/checker to
        checker-framework-eclipse-plugin if you want to run the plugin using the following instructions:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>open the checker-framework-eclipse-plugin project in Eclipse</li>
        <li>Click on plugin.xml</li>
        <li>Use the "run" action in Eclipse</li>
        <li>The resulting dialog has two options: "Run as Eclipse Application" and
            "Debug as Eclipse Application".  Choose "Debug as Eclipse Application"</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Since the Checker Framework process is run in another process from Eclipse,
        setting a breakpoint in Checker Framework code will NOT cause Eclipse to pause at this code.  One
        way of debugging this other process is to pass <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#debugging-options">debug arguments (see 23.8.5)</a>
        in the Eclipse->Checker Framework preferences.  This will cause the Checker Framework to pause and wait
        for a debugger before Executing.  You can then hook another debugger to this process to debug it separately
        from the process used to debug the Eclipse plugin.
    </div>
</section>

<section id="tips">
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    This section outlines the small things that disproportionally slowed development down when fixing the Eclipse plugin.

    <h4>Eclipse With RCP</h4>
    Eclipse  can download all of the requirements for building the Eclipse plugin.  However, downloading an RCP
    version of eclipse will ensure there will be no missing development plugins (though we have gotten
    Eclipse 4.2 to build the plugin without doing this).

    <h4>Eclipse Caches the Universe</h4>
    Eclipse likes to cache everything and be as lazy as possible.  Even if you told eclipse to uninstall a plugin it
    will hold it in its plugin directory for later and merely remove the feature from the installation.  This means,
    if you don't bump the version number when you are testing a version of the plugin then it will use the old version
    it has cached rather than downloading the new version from the update site.  Futhermore, even if you delete the
    plugin folder from the plugin directory it keeps a record in artifact.xml of the plugin's existence and will
    throw an exception when you try to download the plugin again if you do not remove that record.  Finally, sometimes,
    even if you have deleted the feature, plugin, and edited the artifact.xml the menu extensions for the old plugin
    will still appear using the new plugin.  Therefore, the suggested workflow is to just keep a "GOLD" copy of
    eclipse that does not have the plugin installed in it.  And every time you have a new plugin version to work w
    ith (after you have tested it just using your development environment) do one last test on a clean version of
    eclipse with no plugin installed.

    <h4>Special File Editors</h4>
    For plugin related files, there are often custom file editors.  Sometimes, the UIs for these plugins don't
    actually edit the underlying file.  For instance, in Eclipse 3.7 we ran into a problem where, when we checked
    "Unpack this jar", the output plugin.xml remained unchanged.  You must manually set unpack=true.

    <h4>Clean Before Building</h4>
    When generating the update site it would be wise to tell the Eclipse IDE to clean the plugin and update site first.
    If an old version of class files exist, and Eclipse has not detected the source files have changed, then it
    might just use the old class files rather than the new ones.
