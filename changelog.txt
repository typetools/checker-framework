Version 3.0.1, December 2, 2019

New command-line option for the Constant Value Checker
`-AnoNullStringsConcatenation` unsoundly assumes that every operand of a String
concatenation is non-null.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.9.0, July 3, 2019

Renamed the Signedness Checker's @Constant annotation to @SignednessGlb.
Introduced an alias, @SignedPositive, for use by programmers.

Annotated the first argument of Opt.get and Opt.orElseThrow as @NonNull.

Removed meta-annotation @ImplicitFor:
 * Use the new meta-annotation @QualifierForLiteral to replace
   @ImplicitFor(literals, stringpatterns).
 * Use the meta-annotation @DefaultFor to replace @ImplicitFor(typeKinds,
   types).

Version 2.8.2, June 3, 2019

The Signature Checker supports a new type, @FqBinaryName.

Added a template for a repository that you can use to write a custom checker.

Linked to the Checker Framework Gradle plugin, which makes it easy to run
a checker on a project that is built using the Gradle build tool.

Implementation detail: deprecated TreeUtils.skipParens in favor of
TreeUtils.withoutParens which has the same specification.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.8.0, April 3, 2019

Support `androidx.annotation.RecentlyNonNull` and `RecentlyNullable` (as of
2.6.0, but not previously documented).

The following qualifiers are now repeatable:  `@DefaultQualifier`
`@EnsuresQualifierIf` `@EnsuresQualifier` `@RequiresQualifier`.  Therefore,
users generally do not need to write the following wrapper annotations:
`@DefaultQualifiers` `@EnsuresQualifiersIf` `@EnsuresQualifiers`
`@RequiresQualifiers`.

New command-line option `-ArequirePrefixInWarningSuppressions` makes
`@SuppressWarnings` recognize warning keys of the form
"checkername:key.about.problem" but ignore warning keys of the form
"key.about.problem" without the checker name as a prefix.

New CONSTRUCTOR_RESULT enum constant in TypeUseLocation makes it possible to
set default annotations for constructor results.

Clarified the semantics of annotations on class and constructor declarations.
See Section 25.5 "Annotations on classes and constructors" in the manual.

Interface changes:
 * Added protected methods to BaseTypeVisitor so that checkers can change the
   checks for annotations on classes, constructor declarations, and constructor
   invocations.
 * Removed BaseTypeVisitor#checkAssignability and BaseTypeVisitor#isAssignable
   methods.
 * Renamed AnnotatedTypeFactory#getEnclosingMethod to
   AnnotatedTypeFactory#getEnclosingElementForArtificialTree

that no weak cipher algorithms are used with the Java crypto API.

The Nullness Checker supports RxJava annotations
io.reactivex.annotations.NonNull and io.reactivex.annotations.Nullable.

The checker-qual artifact (jar file) contains an OSGi manifest.

New TYPE_DECLARATION enum constant in TypeUseLocation makes it possible to
(for example) set defaults annotations for class/interface definitions.

Interface changes:
 * Renamed the "value" element of the @HasSubsequence annotation to
   "subsequence".
 * Renamed @PolySignedness to @PolySigned.
 * Renamed AnnotatedTypeFactory.ParameterizedMethodType to
   ParameterizedExecutableType.

Added missing checks regarding annotations on classes, constructor
declarations, and constructor invocations.  You may see new warnings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.5.6, October 3, 2018

Introduce checker-qual-android artifact that is just like the checker-qual
artifact, but the qualifiers have classfile retention.  This is useful for
Android projects.

Remove the checker-compat-qual artifact, which was only useful for Java 7,
which the Checker Framework no longer supports.  It remains available on
Maven Central, with versions 2.5.5 and earlier.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.2.0, September 5, 2017

A Java 8 JVM is required to run the Checker Framework.
You can still typecheck and compile Java 7 (or earlier) code.
With the "-target 7" flag, the resulting .class files still run with JDK 7.

The stub file format has changed to be more similar to regular Java syntax.
Most notably, receiver annotations are written using standard Java 8 syntax
(a special first formal paramter named "this") and inner classes are written
using standard Java syntax (rather than at the top level using a name that
contains "$". You need to update your stub files to conform to the new syntax.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.14, 3 August 2017

Nullness Checker change to annotated JDK:  The type argument to the Class,
Constructor, and Optional classes may now be annotated as @Nullable or
@NonNull.  The nullness of the type argument doesn't matter, but this
enables easier integration with generic clients.

Many crashes and false positives associated with uninferred method type
arguments have been correct. By default, uninferred method type arguments,
which can happen with Java 8 style target type contexts, are silently ignored.
Use the option -AconservativeUninferredTypeArguments to see warnings about
method calls where the Checker Framework fails to infer type arguments.

Version 2.1.5, 2 November 2016

The new class org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.Opt provides every
method in Java 8's java.util.Optional class, but written for possibly-null
references rather than for the Optional type.  This can shorten code that
manipulates possibly-null references.

In bytecode, type variable upper bounds of type Object may or may not have
been explicitly written.  The Checker Framework now assumes they were not
written explicitly in source code and defaults them as implicit upper bounds.

The manual describes how to run a checker within the NetBeans IDE.

The manual describes two approaches to creating a type alias or typedef.

The new Signedness Checker prevents mixing of unsigned and signed
values and prevents meaningless operations on unsigned values.

The Lock Checker expresses the annotated variable as `<self>`;
previously it used `itself`, which may conflict with an identifier.

Closed issues:
166, 273, 358, 408, 471, 484, 594, 625, 692, 700, 701, 711, 717, 752, 756,
759, 763, 767, 779, 783, 794, 807, 808.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0.1, 1 June 2016

We renamed method annotateImplicit to addComputedTypeAnnotations.  If you
have implemented a checker, you need to change occurrences of
annotateImplicit to addComputedTypeAnnotations.

The Checker Framework (checker.jar) is now placed on the processorpath
during compilation.  Previously, it was placed on the classpath.  The
qualifiers (checker-qual.jar) remain on the classpath.  This change should
reduce conflicts between your code and the Checker Framework.  If your code
depends on classes in the Checker Framework, then you should add those
classes to the classpath when you run the compiler.

Closed issues:
171, 250, 291, 523, 577, 672, 680, 688, 689, 690, 691, 695, 696, 698, 702,
704, 705, 706, 707, 720, 721, 723, 728, 736, 738, 740.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.0.0, 2 May 2016

Inference:

 * The infer-and-annotate.sh script infers annotations and inserts them in
   your source code.  This can reduce the burden of writing annotations and
   let you get started using a type system more quickly.  See the
   "Whole-program inference" section in the manual for details.

Type systems:

 * The Lock Checker has been replaced by a new implementation that provides
   a stronger guarantee.  The old Lock Checker prevented two threads from
   simultaneously using a given variable, but race conditions were still
   possible due to aliases.  The new Lock Checker prevents two threads from
   simultaneously dereferencing a given value, and thus prevents race
   conditions.  For details, see the "Lock Checker" chapter in the manual,
   which has been rewritten to describe the new semantics.

 * The top type qualifier for the Signature String type system has been
   renamed from @UnannotatedString to @SignatureUnknown.  You shouldn't
   ever write this annotation, but if you perform separate compilation (for
   instance, if you do type-checking with the Signature String Checker
   against a library that is annotated with Signature String annotations),
   then you need to re-compile the library.

 * The IGJ, OIGJ, and Javari Checkers are no longer distributed with the
   Checker Framework.  If you wish to use them, install version 1.9.13 of
   the Checker Framework.  The implementations have been removed because
   they were not being maintained.  The type systems are valuable, but the
   type-checkers should be rewritten from scratch.

Documentation improvements:

 * New manual section "Tips for creating a checker" shows how to break down
   the implementation of a type system into small, manageable pieces.

 * Improved instructions for using Maven and Gradle, including for Android
   code.

Tool changes:

 * The Checker Framework Live Demo webpage lets you try the Checker
   Framework without installing it:  http://eisop.uwaterloo.ca/live/

 * New command-line arguments -Acfgviz and -Averbosecfg enable better
   debugging of the control-flow-graph generation step of type-checking.

 * New command-line argument -Ainfer is used by the infer-and-annotate.sh
   script that performs type inference.

Closed issues:
69, 86, 199, 299, 329, 421, 428, 557, 564, 573, 579, 665, 668, 669, 670, 671.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.13, 1 April 2016

Documentation:
 * Clarified Maven documentation about use of annotations in comments.
 * Added FAQ about annotating fully-qualified type names.

Closed issues:  438, 572, 579, 607, 624, 631.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.12, 1 March 2016

The Checker Framework distribution contains annotated versions
of libraries in directory checker-framework/checker/lib/.
During type-checking, you should put these versions first on your classpath,
to obtain more precise type-checking with fewer false positive warnings.

tools.jar is no longer required to be on the classpath when using
checker-qual.jar

The Signature String Checker supports two new string representations of a
Java type: @InternalForm and @ClassGetSimpleName.

The manual documents how to run a pluggable type-checker in IntelliJ IDEA.

The instructions on how to run a type-checker in Gradle have been updated to
use the artifacts in Maven Central. Examples using the instructions have been
added under checker-framework/docs/examples/GradleExamples/.

Renamed enum DefaultLocation to TypeUseLocation.

Closed issues:  130, 263, 345, 458, 559, 559, 574, 582, 596.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.11, 1 February 2016

Renamed and merged -AuseSafeDefaultsForUnannotatedSourceCode and
-AsafeDefaultsForUnannotatedBytecode command-line options to
-AuseDefaultsForUncheckedCode that takes arguments source and bytecode.

For type-system developers:

* The previously deprecated
  org.checkerframework.framework.qual.TypeQualifier{s} annotations
  were removed.
* Every type system uses the CLIMB-to-top defaulting scheme, unless it
  explicitly specifies a different one.  Previously a type system needed
  to explicitly request CLIMB-to-top, but now it is the default.

Closed issues: 524, 563, 568.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.10, 4 January 2016

The Checker Framework distribution files now contain a version number:
for example, checker-framework-1.9.9.zip rather than checker-framework.zip.

The Nullness Checker supports the org.eclipse.jgit.annotations.Nullable and
NonNull annotations.

Buildfiles do less unnecessary recomputation.

Documentation:
 * Documented how to initialize circular data structures in the
   Initialization type system.
 * Linked to David Bürgin's Nullness Checker tutorial at
   https://github.com/glts/safer-spring-petclinic/wiki
 * Acknowledged more contributors in the manual.

For type-system developers:
 * The org.checkerframework.framework.qual.TypeQualifier{s} annotations are
   now deprecated.  To indicate which annotations a checker supports, see
   https://checkerframework.org/manual/#creating-indicating-supported-annotations .
   Support for TypeQualifier{s} will be removed in the next release.
 * Renamed
   org.checkerframework.framework.qual.Default{,Qualifier}ForUnannotatedCode to
   DefaultInUncheckedCodeFor and DefaultQualifierInHierarchyInUncheckedCode.

Closed issues: 169, 363, 448, 478, 496, 516, 529.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.9, 1 December 2015

Fixed issues:  511, 513, 514, 455, 527.

Removed the javac_maven script and batch file,
which had been previously deprecated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.8, 9 November 2015

Field initialization warnings can now be suppressed for a single field at a
time, by placing @SuppressWarnings("initialization") on the field declaration.

Updated Maven instructions to no longer require a script.
Added an example of how to use the instructions under
docs/examples/MavenExample.

The javac_maven script (and batch file) are deprecated and will be
removed as of December 2015.

Fixed issues:  487, 500, 502.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.7, 24 October 2015

Fixed issues:  291, 474.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.6, 8 October 2015

Fixed issue:  460.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.5, 1 September 2015

Test Framework Updates:
  * The test framework has been refactored to improve extensibility.
  * Tests that previously extended ParameterizedCheckerTest or
    CheckerTest should extend either CheckerFrameworkTest or nothing.
  * If a test used methods that were previously found on
    CheckerTest, you may find them in TestUtilities.

Fixed issues:  438, 457, 459.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.4, 4 August 2015

Documented the notion of a compound checker, which depends on other checkers
  and automatically runs them.

Renamed -AuseConservativeDefaultsForUnannotatedSourceCode command-line
  option to -AuseSafeDefaultsForUnannotatedSourceCode

Moved the Checker Framework version control repository from Google Code to
GitHub, and from the Mercurial version control system to Git.  If you have
cloned the old repository, then discard your old clone and create a new one
using this command:
  git clone https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework.git

Fixed issues:  427, 429, 434, 442, 450.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.3, 1 July 2015

New command-line options:
 * -AsafeDefaultsForUnannotatedBytecode causes a checker to use conservative
   defaults for .class files that were compiled without running the given
   checker.  Without this option, type-checking is unsound (that is, there
   might be errors at run time even though the checker issues no warnings).
 * -AuseConservativeDefaultsForUnannotatedSourceCode uses conservative
   annotations for unannotated type uses.  Use this when compiling a library in
   which some but not all classes are annotated.

Various bug fixes and documentation improvements.

Fixed issues: 436.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.2, 1 June 2015

Internationalization Format String Checker:
This new type-checker prevents use of incorrect internationalization
format strings.

Fixed issues: 434.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.1, 1 May 2015

New FAQ entry:
  "How does the Checker Framework compare with Eclipse's null analysis?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.9.0, 17 April 2015

Bug fixes for generics, especially type parameters:
   * Manual chapter 21 "Generics and polymorphism" has been expanded,
     and it gives more information on annotating type parameters.
   * The qualifier on a type parameter (e.g. <@HERE T> ) only applies
     to the lower bound of that type parameter.  Previously it also
     applied to the upper bound.
   * Unannotated, unbounded wildcards are now qualified with the
     annotations of the type parameter to which they are an argument.
     See the new manual section 23.3.4 for more details.
   * Warning "bound.type.incompatible" is issued if the lower bound of
     a type parameter or wildcard is a supertype of its upper bound,
     e.g.  <@Nullable T extends @NonNull Object>
   * Method type argument inference has been improved. Fewer warnings
     should be issued when method invocations omit type arguments.
   * Added command-line option -AprintVerboseGenerics to print more
     information about type parameters and wildcards when they appear
     in warning messages.

Reflection resolution:
If you supply the -AresolveReflection command-line option, the Checker
Framework attempts to resolve reflection.  This reduces the number of
false positive warnings caused by reflection.

The documentation for the Map Key Checker has been moved into its own
chapter in the manual.

Fixed issues: 221, 241, 313, 314, 328, 335, 337, 338, 339, 355, 369,
              376, 378, 386, 388, 389, 393, 403, 404, 413, 414, 415,
              417, 418, 420, 421, 422, 426.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.10, 30 January 2015

Fixed issues: 37, 127, 350, 364, 365, 387, 392, 395.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.9, 19 December 2014

Aliasing Checker:
This new type-checker ensures that an expression has no aliases.

Fixed issues: 362, 380, 382.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.8, 26 November 2014

@SuppressWarnings("all") suppresses all Checker Framework warnings.

Implicit imports are deprecated, including the jsr308_imports environment
variable and the -jsr308_imports ... and -Djsr308.imports=... command-line
options.

For checkers bundled with the Checker Framework, package names may now
be omitted when running from the command line.
E.g.
    javac -processor NullnessChecker MyFile.java

The Nullness checker supports Android annotations
android.support.annotation.NonNull and android.support.annotation.Nullable.

Fixed issues: 366, 379.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.7, 30 October 2014

Fix performance regression introduced in release 1.8.6.

Nullness Checker:
  * Updated Nullness annotations in the annotated JDK.
    See issues: 336, 340, 374.
  * String concatenations with null literals are now @NonNull
    rather than @Nullable.  See issue 357.

Fixed issues:  200, 300, 332, 336, 340, 357, 359, 373, 374.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.6, 25 September 2014

Method Reference and Lambda Expression Support:
The Checker Framework now supports type-checking method references
and lambda expressions to ensure they are congruent with the
functional interface they are assigned to. The bodies of lambda expressions
are also now type-checked similarly to regular method bodies.

Dataflow:
 * Handling of the following language features has been improved:
   boxed Booleans, finally blocks, switch statements, type casts, enhanced
   for loops
 * Performance improvements

Annotations:
The checker-compat-qual.jar is now included with the Checker Framework
release.  It can also be found in Maven Central at the coordinates:
org.checkerframework:checker-compat-qual
Annotations in checker-compat-qual.jar do not require Java 8 but
can only be placed in annotation locations valid in Java 7.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.5, 29 August 2014

Eclipse Plugin:
All checkers in the Checker Framework manual now appear in the
Eclipse plugin by default.  Users no longer have to include
checker.jar on their classpath to run any of the built-in checkers.

Improved Java 7 compatibility and introduced Java 7 compliant
annotations for the Nullness Checker.  Please see the section on
"Class-file compatibility with Java 7" in the manual for more details.

Fixed issue 347.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.4, 1 August 2014

The new Constant Value Checker is a constant propagation analysis:  it
determines which variable values can be known at compile time.

Overriding methods now inherit declaration annotations from methods they
override, if the declaration annotation is meta-annotate with
@InheritedAnnotation.  In particular, the purity annotations @SideEffectFree,
@Deterministic, and @Pure are inherited.

Command-line options:
 * Renamed the -AenablePurity command-line flag to -AcheckPurityAnnotations.
 * Added a command-line option -AoutputArgsToFile to output all command-line
   options passed to the compiler to a file.  This is especially useful when
   debugging Maven compilation.

Annotations:
These changes are relevant only to people who wish to use pluggable
type-checking with a standard Java 7 toolset.  (If you are not having
trouble with your Java 7 JVM, then you don't care about them.)
 * Made clean-room reimplementations of nullness-related annotations
   compatible with Java 7 JVMs, by removing TYPE_USE as a target.
 * Added a new set of Java 7 compatibility annotations for the Nullness Checker
   in the org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.compatqual package. These
   annotations do not require Java 8 but can only be placed in annotation
   locations valid in Java 7.

Java 8 support:
The Checker Framework no longer crashes when type-checking code with lambda
expressions, but it does issue a lambda.unsupported warning when
type-checking code containing lambda expressions.  Full support for
type-checking lambda expressions will appear in a future release.

Fixed issue 343.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.3, 1 July 2014

Updated the Initialization Checker section in the manual with
a new introduction paragraph.

Removed the Maven plugin section from the manual as the plugin is
no longer maintained and the final release was on June 2, 2014.
The javac_maven script (and batch file) are available to use
the Checker Framework from Maven.

Fixed issue 331.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.2, 2 Jun 2014

Converted from using rt.jar to ct.sym for creating the annotated jdk.
Using the annotated jdk on the bootclasspath of a VM will cause the
vm to crash immediately.

The Lock Checker has been rewritten to support dataflow analysis.
It can now understand conditional expressions, for example, and
knows that "lock" is held in the body of statements like
"if (lock.tryLock()) { ... }"
The Lock Checker chapter in the manual has been updated accordingly
and describes the new Lock Checker features in detail.

Provided a javac_maven script (and batch file) to make it simpler
to use the Checker Framework from Maven.  The Maven plug-in is deprecated
and will be removed as of July 1, 2014. Added an explanation of how
to use the script in the Maven section of the manual.

The Checker Framework installation instructions in the manual have
been updated.

Fixed issues: 312, 315, 316, 318, 319, 324, 326, 327.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.1, 1 May 2014

Support to directly use the Java 8 javac in addition to jsr308-langtools.
Added docs/examples directory to checker-framework.zip.
New section in the manual describing the contents of checker-framework.zip.

Fixed issues: 204, 304, 320.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.8.0, 2 April 2014

Added the GUI Effect Checker, which prevents "invalid thread access" errors
when a background thread in a GUI attempts to access the UI.

Changed the Java package of all type-checkers and qualifiers.  The package
"checkers" has been renamed to "org.checkerframeork.checker".  This
requires you to change your import statements, such as from
  import checkers.nullness.quals.*;
to
  import org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual.*;
It also requires you to change command-line invocations of javac, such as from
  javac -processor checkers.nullness.NullnessChecker ...
to
  javac -processor org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker ...

Restructured the Checker Framework project and package layout,
using the org.checkerframework prefix.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.7.5, 5 March 2014

Minor improvements to documentation and demos.
Support a few new units in the UnitsChecker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.7.4, 19 February 2014

Error messages now display the error key that can be used in
SuppressWarning annotations. Use -AshowSuppressWarningKeys to
show additional keys.

Defaulted type qualifiers are now stored in the Element and written
to the final bytecode.

Reduce special treatment of checkers.quals.Unqualified.

Fixed issues: 170, 240, 265, 281.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.7.3, 4 February 2014

Fixes for Issues 210, 253, 280, 288.

Manual:
   Improved discussion of checker guarantees.

Maven Plugin:
   Added option useJavacOutput to display exact compiler output.

Eclipse Plugin:
   Added the Format String Checker to the list of built-in checkers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.7.2, 2 January 2014

Fixed issues: 289, 292, 295, 296, 298.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.7.1, 9 December 2013

Fixes for Issues 141, 145, 257, 261, 269, 267, 275, 278, 282, 283, 284, 285.

Implementation details:
  Renamed AbstractBasicAnnotatedTypeFactory to GenericAnnotatedTypeFactory

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.7.0, 23 October 2013

Format String Checker:
  This new type-checker ensures that format methods, such as
  System.out.printf, are invoked with correct arguments.

Renamed the Basic Checker to the Subtyping Checker.

Reimplemented the dataflow analysis that performs flow-sensitive type
  refinement.  This fixes many bugs, improves precision, and adds features.
  Many more Java expressions can be written as annotation arguments.

Initialization Checker:
  This new abstract type-checker verifies initialization properties.  It
  needs to be combined with another type system whose proper initialization
  should be checked.  This is the new default initialzation checker for the
  Nullness Checker.  It is based on the "Freedom Before Commitment" approach.

Renamed method annotations used by the Nullness Checker:
  @AssertNonNullAfter => @EnsuresNonNull
  @NonNullOnEntry => @RequiresNonNull
  @AssertNonNullIfTrue(...) => @IfMethodReturnsFalseEnsuresNonNull
  @AssertNonNullIfFalse(...) => @IfMethodReturnsFalseEnsuresNonNull
  @LazyNonNull => @MonotonicNonNull
  @AssertParametersNonNull => [no replacement]
Removed annotations used by the Nullness Checker:
  @AssertParametersNonNull
Renamed type annotations used by the Initialization Checker:
  @NonRaw => @Initialized
  @Raw => @UnknownInitialization
  new annotation @UnderInitialization
The old Initialization Checker (that uses @Raw and @NonRaw) can be invoked
  by invoking the NullnessRawnessChecker rather than the NullnessChecker.

Purity (side effect) analysis uses new annotations @SideEffectFree,
  @Deterministic, and @TerminatesExecution; @Pure means both @SideEffectFree
  and @Deterministic.

Pre- and postconditions about type qualifiers are available for any type system
  through @RequiresQualifier, @EnsuresQualifier and @EnsuresQualifierIf.  The
  contract annotations for the Nullness Checker (e.g. @EnsuresNonNull) are now
  only a special case of these general purpose annotations.
  The meta-annotations @PreconditionAnnotation, @PostconditionAnnotation, and
  @ConditionalPostconditionAnnotation can be used to create more special-case
  annotations for other type systems.

Renamed assertion comment string used by all checkers:
  @SuppressWarnings => @AssumeAssertion

To use an assert statement to suppress warnings, the assertion message must
  include the string "@AssumeAssertion(warningkey)".  Previously, just the
  warning key sufficed, but the string @SuppressWarnings(warningkey) was
  recommended.

New command-line options:
  -AonlyDefs and -AonlyUses complement existing -AskipDefs and -AskipUses
  -AsuppressWarnings Suppress warnings matching the given key
  -AassumeSideEffectFree Unsoundly assume that every method is side-effect-free
  -AignoreRawTypeArguments Ignore subtype tests for type arguments that
    were inferred for a raw type
  -AenablePurity Check the bodies of methods marked as pure
    (@SideEffectFree or @Deterministic)
  -AsuggestPureMethods Suggest methods that could be marked as pure
  -AassumeAssertionsAreEnabled, -AassumeAssertionsAreDisabled Whether to
    assume that assertions are enabled or disabled
  -AconcurrentSemantics Whether to assume concurrent semantics
  -Anocheckjdk Don't err if no annotated JDK can be found
  -Aflowdotdir Create an image of the control flow graph
  -AinvariantArrays replaces -Alint=arrays:invariant
  -AcheckCastElementType replaces -Alint=cast:strict

Manual:
  New manual section about array types.
  New FAQ entries:  "Which checker should I start with?", "How can I handle
    typestate, or phases of my program with different data properties?",
    "What is the meaning of a type qualifier at a class declaration?"
  Reorganized FAQ chapter into sections.
  Many other improvements.

  The maven plugin no longer attempts to resolve jdk6.jar

Eclipse plugin:
  Put Checker Framework jars at the beginning of classpath.
  All files selected from a single project can now be checked.  The previous behavior only checked the entire project or one file depending on the type of the first file selected.

Documentation:
  Fixed broken links and incomplete URLs in the Checker Framework Manual.
  Update FAQ to discuss that some other tools incorrectly interpret array declarations.

Bug fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.6.0, 1 Feb 2013

User-visible framework improvements:
  It is possible to use enum constants in stub files without requiring the fully qualified name, as was previously necessary.
  Support build on a stock Java 8 OpenJDK.

Adapt to underlying jsr308-langtools changes.
  The most visible change is syntax for fully-qualified types, from @A java.lang.Object to java.lang.@A Object.
  JDK 7 is now required.  The Checker Framework does not build or run on JDK 6.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.5.0, 14 Jan 2013

User-visible framework improvements:
  To invoke the Checker Framework, call the main method of class
    CheckerMain, which is a drop-in replacement for javac.  This replaces
    all previous techniques for invoking the Checker Framework.  Users
    should no longer provide any Checker Framework jars on the classpath or
    bootclasspath.  jsr308-all.jar has been removed.
  The Checker Framework now works with both JDK 6 and JDK 7, without need
    for user customization.  The Checker Framework determines the
    appropriate annotated JDK to use.
  All jar files now reside in checker-framework/checkers/binary/.

Maven plugin:
  Individual pom files (and artifacts in the Maven repository) for all
    Checker Framework jar files.
  Avoid too-long command lines on Windows.
  See the Maven section of the manual for more details.

Eclipse plugin:
  Avoid too-long command lines on Windows.
  Other bug fixes and interface improvements.

Other framework improvements:
  New -Adetailedmsgtext command-line option, intended for use by IDE plugins.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4.4, 1 Dec 2012

Internal framework improvements:
  Add shutdown hook mechanism and use it for -AresourceStats resource
    statistics flag.
  Add -AstubWarnIfNotFound and -AstubDebug options to improve
    warnings and debug information from the stub file parsing.
  Ignore case when comparing error suppression keys.
  Support the bottom type as subtype of any wildcard type.

Tool Integration Changes
  The Maven plugin id has been changed to reflect standard Maven
    naming conventions.
  Eclipse and Maven plugin version numbers will now
    track the Checker Framework version numbers.

Bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4.3, 1 Nov 2012

Clarify license:
  The Checker Framework is licensed under the GPL2.  More permissive
    licenses apply to annotations, tool plugins (Maven, Eclipse),
    external libraries included with the Checker Framework, and examples in
    the Checker Framework Manual.
  Replaced all third-party annotations by cleanroom implementations, to
    avoid any potential problems or confusion with licensing.

Aliased annotations:
  Clarified that there is no need to rewrite your program.  The Checker
    Framework recognizes dozens of annotations used by other tools.

Improved documentation of Units Checker and Gradle Integration.
Improved developer documentation of Eclipse and Maven plugins.

Bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4.2, 16 Oct 2012

External tool support:
  Eclipse plug-in now works properly, due to many fixes

Regex Checker:
  New CheckedPatternSyntaxException added to RegexUtil

Support new foreign annotations:
  org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.Nullable
  org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.NonNull

New FAQ: "What is a receiver?"

Make annotations use 1-based numbering for formal parameters:
  Previously, due to a bug the annotations used 0-based numbering.
  This change means that you need to rewrite annotations in the following ways:
    @KeyFor("#3")  =>  @KeyFor("#4")
    @AssertNonNullIfTrue("#0")  =>  @AssertNonNullIfTrue("#1")
    @AssertNonNullIfTrue({"#0", "#1"})  =>  @AssertNonNullIfTrue({"#1", "#2"})
    @AssertNonNullAfter("get(#2)")  =>  @AssertNonNullAfter("get(#3)")
  This command:
    find . -type f -print | xargs perl -pi -e 's/("#)([0-9])(")/$1.($2+1).$3/eg'
  handles the first two cases, which account for most uses.  You would need
  to handle any annotations like the last two cases in a different way,
  such as by running
    grep -r -n -E '\("[^"]+#[0-9][^A-Za-z]|\("#[0-9][^"]' .
  and making manual changes to the matching lines.  (It is possible to
  provide a command that handles all cases, but it would be more likely to
  make undesired changes.)
  Whenever making automated changes, it is wise to save a copy of your
  codebase, then compare it to the modified version so you can undo any
  undesired changes.  Also, avoid running the automated command over version
  control files such as your .hg, .git, .svn, or CVS directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4.1, 29 Sep 2012

User-visible framework improvements:
  Support stub files contained in .jar files.
  Support aliasing for declaration annotations.
  Updated the Maven plugin.

Code refactoring:
  Make AnnotationUtils and AnnotatedTypes into stateless utility classes.
    Instead, provide the necessary parameters for particular methods.
  Make class AnnotationBuilder independent of AnnotationUtils.
  Remove the ProcessingEnvironment from AnnotatedTypeMirror, which was
    hardly used and can be replaced easily.
  Used more consistent naming for a few more fields.
  Moved AnnotatedTypes from package checkers.types to checkers.utils.
    this required making a few methods in AnnotatedTypeFactory public,
    which might require changes in downstream code.

Internal framework improvements:
  Fixed Issues 136, 139, 142, 156.
  Bug fixes and documentation improvements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.4.0, 11 Sep 2012

User-visible framework improvements:
  Defaulting:
    @DefaultQualifier annotations now use a Class instead of a String,
      preventing simple typo errors.
    @DefaultLocation extended with more constants.
    TreeAnnotator propagates the least-upper-bound of the operands of
      binary/compound operations, instead of taking the default qualifier.
  Stub files now ignore the return type, allowing for files automatically
    generated from other formats.
  Type factories and type hierarchies:
    Simplify AnnotatedTypeFactory constructors.
    Add a GeneralAnnotatedTypeFactory that supports multiple type systems.
    Improvements to QualifierHierarchy construction.
  Type-checking improvements:
    Propagate annotations from the sub-expression of a cast to its result.
    Better handling of assignment context and improved inference of
      array creation expressions.
  Optional stricter checking of casts to array and generic types using
    the new -Alint=cast:strict flag.
    This will become the default in the future.
  Code reorganization:
    SourceChecker.initChecker no longer has a ProcessingEnvironment
      parameter. The environment can now be accessed using the standard
      processingEnv field (instead of the previous env field).
    Classes com.sun.source.util.AbstractTypeProcessor and
      checkers.util.AggregateChecker are now in package checkers.source.
    Move isAssignable from the BaseTypeChecker to the BaseTypeVisitor; now
      the Checker only consists of factories and logic is contained in the
      Visitor.
  Warning and error messages:
    Issue a warning if an unsupported -Alint option is provided.
    Improved error messages.
  Maven plugin now works.

Nullness Checker:
  Only allow creation of (implicitly) non-null objects.
  Optionally forbid creation of arrays with @NonNull component type,
    when flag -Alint=arrays:forbidnonnullcomponents is supplied.
    This will become the default in the future.

Internal framework improvements:
  Enable assertion checking.
  Improve handling of annotated type variables.
  Assignment context is now a type, not a tree.
  Fix all compiler warnings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3.1, 21 Jul 2012

Installation:
  Clarify installation instructions for Windows.  Remove javac.bat, which
  worked for running distributed checkers but not for creating new checkers.

User-visible framework improvements:
  Implement @PolyAll qualifier to vary over multiple type systems.
  The Checker Framework is unsound due to Java's covariant array subtyping.
    You can enable invariant array subtyping (for qualifiers only, not for
    base Java types) with the command-line option -Alint=arrays:invariant.
    This will become the default in the future.

Internal framework improvements:
  Improve defaulting for multiple qualifier hierarchies.
  Big refactoring of how qualifier hierarchies are built up.
  Improvements to error handling output for unexpected exceptions.
  Bug fixes and documentation improvements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3.0, 3 Jul 2012

Annotation syntax changes, as mandated by the latest Type Annotations
(JSR 308) specification.  The most important ones are:
- New receiver syntax, using "this" as a formal parameter name:
    ReturnType methodname(@ReceiverAnnotation MyClass this, ...) { ... }
- Changed @Target default to be the Java 1.5 values
- UW extension: in addition to annotations in comments, support
    special /*>>> */ comments to hide multiple tokens.
    This is useful for the new receiver syntax and for import statements.

Framework improvements:
  Adapt to annotation storage changes in jsr308-langtools 1.3.0.
  Move type validation methods from the BaseTypeChecker to BaseTypeVisitor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.7, 14 May 2012

Regex Checker:
  Add basic support for the concatenation of two non-regular expressions
    that produce a valid regular expression.
  Support "isRegex" in flow inference.

Framework improvements:
  New @StubFiles annotation declaratively adds stub files to a checker.

Internal bug fixes:
  Respect skipDefs and skipUses in NullnessFlow.
  Support package annotations in stub files.
  Better support for enums in annotation attributes.
  Cleanups to how implicit receivers are determined.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.6, 18 Mar 2012

Nullness Checker:
  Correctly handle unboxing in more contexts (if, switch (Issue 129),
    while loops, ...)

Regex Checker:
  Add capturing groups parameter to Regex qualifier.
    Count groups in String literals and String concatenation.
    Verify group number to method calls that take a capturing group
      number.
    Update RegexUtil methods to take optional groups parameter.
    Modify regex qualifier hierarchy to support groups parameter.
  Add special case for Pattern.compile when called with Pattern.LITERAL flag.

Internal bug fixes:
  Improve flow's support of annotations with parameters.
  Fix generics corner cases (Issues 131, 132, 133, 135).
  Support type annotations in annotations and type-check annotations.
  Improve reflective look-up of visitors and factories.
  Small cleanups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.5.1, 06 Feb 2012

Nullness Checker:
  Correct the annotations on ThreadLocal and InheritableThreadLocal.

Internal bug fixes:
  Expand release tests.
  Compile release with JDK 6 to work on both JDK 6 and JDK 7.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.5, 3 Feb 2012

Don't put classpath on the bootclasspath when invoking javac.  This
prevents problems if, for example, android.jar is on the classpath.

New -jsr308_imports ... and -Djsr308.imports=... command-line options, for
specifying implicit imports from the command line.  This is needed by Maven.

New -Aignorejdkastub option makes the checker not load the jdk.astub
file. Files from the "stubs" option are still loaded.

Regex Checker:
  Support concatenation of PolyRegex strings.
  Improve examples of use of RegexUtil methods.

Signature Checker:
  Add new @ClassGetName annotation, for a 4th string representation of a
    class that is used by the JDK.  Add supporting annotations to make the
    type hierarchy a complete lattice.
  Add PolySignature annotation.

Internal bug fixes:
  Improve method type argument inference.
  Handle type variables whose upper bound is a type variable.
  Fix bug in least upper bound computation for anonymous classes.
  Improve handling of annotations inherited from superclasses.
  Fix design problem with Nullness Checker and primitive types.
  Ensure that overriding methods respect pre- and postconditions.
  Correctly resolve references to an enclosing this.
  Improve handling of Java source that contains compilation errors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.4, 15 Dec 2011

All checkers:
- @Target(TYPE_USE) meta-annotation is properly handled.

Nullness Checker:
- Do not allow nullness annotations on primitive types.
- Improvements to rawness (initialization) checks.
- Special-case known keys for System.getProperty.
- The -Alint=uninitialized command-line option now defaults to off, and
  applies only to initialization of primitive and @Nullable fields.  It is
  not possible to disable, from the command line, the check that all
  @NonNull fields are initialized.  Such warnings must be suppressed
  explicitly, for example by using @SuppressWarnings.

Regex Checker:
- Improved RegexUtil class.

Manual:
- Add FAQ item "Is the Checker Framework an official part of Java?"
- Trim down README.txt; users should read the manual instead.
- Improvements throughout, especially to Nullness and Regex Checker sections.

Implementation details:
- Add a new @InvisibleQualifier meta-annotation for type qualifiers.
  Instead of special-casing @Unqualified in the AnnotatedTypeMirror it
  now looks for this meta-annotation. This also allows type systems to
  hide type qualifiers it doesn't want visible, which we now use in the
  Nullness Checker to hide the @Primitive annotation.
- Nullness Checker:  Introduce a new internal qualifier @Primitive that is
  used for primitive types.
- Be stricter about qualifiers being present on all types. If you get
  errors about missing qualifiers, check your defaulting rules.
  This helped in fixing small bugs in corner cases of the type
  hierarchy and type factory.
- Unify decoding type annotations from trees and elements.
- Improve handling of annotations on type variables and upper bounds.
- Support checkers that use multiple, disjoint qualifier hierarchies.
- Many bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.3, 1 Nov 2011

Regex Checker:
- Add @PolyRegex polymorphic annotation
- Add more stub library annotations

Implementation details:
- Do not use "null" for unqualified types. Explicitly use @Unqualified
  and be strict about correct usage. If this causes trouble for you,
  check your @ImplicitFor and @DefaultQualifierInHierarchy
  meta-annotations and ensure correct defaulting in your
  AnnotatedTypeFactory.

Bug fixes:
- Correctly handle f-bounded polymorphism. AnnotatedTypeMirror now has
  methods to query the "effective" annotations on a type, which
  handles type variable and wildcard bounds correctly. Also, terminate
  recursions by not doing lazy-initialization of bounds during defaulting.
- Many other small bug fixes and documentation updates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.2, 1 Oct 2011

Be less restrictive about when to start type processing when errors
already exist.
Add -AskipDefs command-line option to not type-check some class
definitions.
Documentation improvements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.1, 20 Sep 2011

Fix issues 109, 110, 111 and various other cleanups.
Improvements to the release process.
Documentation improvements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.0.1, 4 Sep 2011

New version number to stay in sync with JSR 308 compiler bugfix.
No significant changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.0, 2 Sep 2011

Updated to JDK 8. Use -source 8 (the new default) for type annotations.
Documentation improvements
Bug fixes all over

Nullness Checker:
- Correct the upper bounds of all Collection subtypes

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1.5, 22 Jul 2011

Units Checker:
  Instead of conversion routines, provide unit constants, with which
  to multiply unqualified values. This is easier to type and the
  multiplication gets optimized away by the compiler.

Fenum Checker:
  Ensure that the switch statement expression is a supertype of all
  the case expressions.

Implementation details:

- Parse declaration annotations in stub files

- Output error messages instead of raising exceptions. This change
  required us to introduce method "initChecker" in class
  SourceChecker, which should be used instead of "init". This allows
  us to handle the calls to initChecker within the framework.
  Use method "errorAbort" to output an error message and abort
  processing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1.4, 8 Jul 2011

Units Checker (new):
  Ensures operations are performed on variables of correct units of
  measurement (e.g., miles vs. kilometers vs. kilograms).

Changed -AskipClasses command-line option to -AskipUses

Implementation details:

- Improve support for type qualifiers with enum attributes

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1.3, 17 Jun 2011

Interning:
- Add @UsesObjectEquals annotation

Manual:
- Signature Checker is now documented
- Fenum Checker documentation improved
- Small improvements to other sections

Implementation details:

- Updates to the web-site build process

- The BaseTypeVisitor used to provide the same two type parameters as
  class SourceVisitor. However, all subtypes of BaseTypeVisitor were
  instantiated as <Void, Void>. We decided to directly instantiate the
  SourceVisitor as <Void, Void> and removed this complexity.
  Instead, the BaseTypeVisitor is now parameterized by the subtype of
  BaseTypeChecker that should be used. This gives a more concrete type
  to field "checker" and is similar to BasicAnnotatedTypeFactory.

- Added method AnnotatedTypeFactory.typeVariablesFromUse to allow
  type-checkers to adapt the upper bounds of a type variable depending on
  the type instantiation.

- Method type argument inference:
  Changed AnnotatedTypeFactory.methodFromUse to return a Pair consisting
  of the method and the inferred or explicit method type arguments.
  If you override this method, you will need to update your version.
  See this change set for a simple example:
  https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/source/detail?r=8381a213a4

- Testing framework:
  Support for multiple expected errors using the "// :: A :: B :: C" syntax.

Many small updates and fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1.2, 12 Jan 2011

Fake Enum Checker (new):
  A "fake enumeration" is a set of integers rather than a proper Java enum.
  They are used in legacy code and for efficiency (e.g., in Android).  The
  Fake Enum Checker gives them the same safety guarantees as a proper Java
  enum.

Property File Checker (new):
  Ensures that valid keys are used for property files and resource bundles.
  Also includes a checker that code is properly internationalized and a
  checker for compiler message keys as used in the Checker Framework.

Signature Checker (new):
  Ensures that different string representations of a Java type (e.g.,
  "package.Outer.Inner" vs. "package.Outer$Inner" vs. "Lpackage/Outer$Inner;")
  are not misused.

Interning Checker enhancements:
  Issues fewer false positives for code like "a==b || a.equals(b)"

Foreign annotations:
  The Checker Framework supports more non-Checker-Framework annotations.
  This means that it can check already-annotated code without requiring you
  to rewrite your annotations.
    Add as an alias for checkers.interning.quals.Interned:
      com.sun.istack.Interned
    Add as aliases for checkers.nullness.quals.NonNull:
      com.sun.istack.NotNull
      org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.NonNull
    Add as aliases for checkers.nullness.quals.Nullable:
      com.sun.istack.Nullable
      javax.validation.constraints.NotNull
      org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.CheckForNull
      org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.NullAllowed
      org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.NullUnknown

Manual improvements:
  Improve installation instructions
  Rewrite section on generics (thanks to Bert Fernandez and David Cok)
    Also refactor the generics section into its own chapter
  Rewrite section on @Unused and @Dependent
  New manual section: Writing Java expressions as annotation arguments
  Better explanation of warning suppression
  JSR 308 is planned for Java 8, not Java 7

Stub files:
  Support nested classes by expressing them at top level in binary form: A$B
  Improved error reporting when parsing stub files

Annotated JDK:
  New way of generating annotated JDK
  jdk.jar file no longer appears in repository
  Warning if you are not using the annotated JDK.

Miscellaneous:
  Warn if -source command-line argument does not support type annotations

Many bug fixes
  There are too many to list, but some notable ones are to local type
  inference, generics, pre- and post-conditions (e.g., @NonNullOnEntry,
  @AssertNonNull*), and map keys (@KeyFor).  In particular, preconditions
  and map key annotations are now checked, and if they cannot be verified,
  an error is raised; previously, they were not verified, just unsoundly
  trusted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1.1, 18 Sep 2010

Eclipse support:
  Removed the obsolete Eclipse plug-in from repository.  The new one uses a
  different repository
  (http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/checker-plugin/) but a user
  obtains it from the same URL as before:
  https://checkerframework.org/eclipse/

Property Key Checker:
  The property key checker allows multiple resource bundles and the
  simultaneous use of both resource bundles and property files.

Javari Checker:
  Added Javari stub classes for more JDK classes.

Distribution:
  Changed directory structure (top level is "checker-framework"; "checkers"
  is a under that) for consistency with version control repository.

Many documentation improvements and minor bugfixes.

            same values
    AssertNonNullIfFalse - indicates that a field is NonNull if the method
            returns false
  Renamed AssertNonNull to AssertParametersNonNull
  Updated the annotated jdk

Javari Checker

  spurious unexpected Raw warnings

Manual
  Clarified FAQ item regarding why List's type parameter is
    "extends @NonNull Object"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0.3, 5 Dec 2009

Checkers
  New location UPPER_BOUND for DefaultQualifier permits setting the default
    for upper bounds, such as Object in "? extends Object".
  @DefaultQualifier accepts simple names, like @DefaultQualifier("Nullable"),
    rather than requiring @DefaultQualifier("checkers.nullness.quals.Nullable").
  Local variable type inference has improved support for array accesses.
  The repository contains Eclipse project and launch configuration files.
    This is helpful too people who want to build a checker, not to people
    who merely want to run a checker.
  Many bug fixes, including:
    handling wildcard subtyping rules
    stub files and vararg methods being ignored
    nullness and spurious rawness errors
    uses of array clone method (e.g. String[].clone())
    multibound type parameters (e.g. <T extends @A Number & @B Cloneable>)
