Version 1.3.1, 21 Jul 2012

Installation:
  Clarify installation instructions for Windows.  Remove javac.bat, which
  worked for running distributed checkers but not for creating new checkers.

User-visible framework improvements:
  Implement @PolyAll qualifier to vary over multiple type systems.
  The Checker Framework is unsound due to Java's covariant array subtyping.
    You can enable invariant array subtyping (for qualifiers only, not for
    base Java types) with the command-line option -Alint:arrays:invariant.
    This will become the default in the future.

Internal framework improvements:
  Improve defaulting for multiple qualifier hierarchies.
  Big refactoring of how qualifier hierarchies are built up.
  Improvements to error handling output for unexpected exceptions.
  Bug fixes and documentation improvements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3.0, 3 Jul 2012

Annotation syntax changes, as mandated by the latest Type Annotations
(JSR 308) specification.  The most important ones are:
- New receiver syntax, using "this" as a formal parameter name:
    ReturnType methodname(@ReceiverAnnotation MyClass this, ...) { ... }
- Changed @Target default to be the Java 1.5 values
- UW extension: in addition to annotations in comments, support
    special /*>>> */ comments to hide multiple tokens.
    This is useful for the new receiver syntax and for import statements.

Framework improvements:
  Adapt to annotation storage changes in jsr308-langtools 1.3.0.
  Move type validation methods from the BaseTypeChecker to BaseTypeVisitor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.7, 14 May 2012

Regex Checker:
  Add basic support for the concatenation of two non-regular expressions
    that produce a valid regular expression.
  Support "isRegex" in flow inference.

Framework improvements:
  New @StubFiles annotation declaratively adds stub files to a checker.

Internal bug fixes:
  Respect skipDefs and skipUses in NullnessFlow.
  Support package annotations in stub files.
  Better support for enums in annotation attributes.
  Cleanups to how implicit receivers are determined.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.6, 18 Mar 2012

Nullness Checker:
  Correctly handle unboxing in more contexts (if, switch (Issue 129),
    while loops, ...)

Regex Checker:
  Add capturing groups parameter to Regex qualifier.
    Count groups in String literals and String concatenation.
    Verify group number to method calls that take a capturing group
      number.
    Update RegexUtil methods to take optional groups parameter.
    Modify regex qualifier hierarchy to support groups parameter.
  Add special case for Pattern.compile when called with Pattern.LITERAL flag.

Internal bug fixes:
  Improve flow's support of annotations with parameters.
  Fix generics corner cases (Issues 131, 132, 133, 135).
  Support type annotations in annotations and type check annotations.
  Improve reflective look-up of visitors and factories.
  Small cleanups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.5.1, 06 Feb 2012

Nullness Checker:
  Correct the annotations on ThreadLocal and InheritableThreadLocal.

Internal bug fixes:
  Expand release tests.
  Compile release with JDK 6 to work on both JDK 6 and JDK 7.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.5, 3 Feb 2012

Don't put classpath on the bootclasspath when invoking javac.  This
prevents problems if, for example, android.jar is on the classpath.

New -jsr308_imports ... and -Djsr308.imports=... command-line options, for
specifying implicit imports from the command line.  This is needed by Maven.

New -Aignorejdkastub option makes the checker not load the jdk.astub
file. Files from the "stubs" option are still loaded.

Regex Checker:
  Support concatenation of PolyRegex strings.
  Improve examples of use of RegexUtil methods.

Signature Checker:
  Add new @ClassGetName annotation, for a 4th string representation of a
    class that is used by the JDK.  Add supporting annotations to make the
    type hierarchy a complete lattice.
  Add PolySignature annotation.

Internal bug fixes:
  Improve method type argument inference.
  Handle type variables whose upper bound is a type variable.
  Fix bug in least upper bound computation for anonymous classes.
  Improve handling of annotations inherited from superclasses.
  Fix design problem with Nullness Checker and primitive types.
  Ensure that overriding methods respect pre- and postconditions.
  Correctly resolve references to an enclosing this.
  Improve handling of Java source that contains compilation errors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.4, 15 Dec 2011

All checkers:
- @Target(TYPE_USE) meta-annotation is properly handled.

Nullness Checker:
- Do not allow nullness annotations on primitive types.
- Improvements to rawness (initialization) checks.
- Special-case known keys for System.getProperty.
- The -Alint=uninitialized command-line option now defaults to off, and
  applies only to initialization of primitive and @Nullable fields.  It is
  not possible to disable, from the command line, the check that all
  @NonNull fields are initialized.  Such warnings must be suppressed
  explicitly, for example by using @SuppressWarnings.

Regex Checker:
- Improved RegexUtil class.

Manual:
- Add FAQ item "Is the Checker Framework an official part of Java?"
- Trim down README.txt; users should read the manual instead.
- Improvements throughout, especially to Nullness and Regex Checker sections.

Implementation details:
- Add a new @InvisibleQualifier meta-annotation for type qualifiers.
  Instead of special-casing @Unqualified in the AnnotatedTypeMirror it
  now looks for this meta-annotation. This also allows type systems to
  hide type qualifiers it doesn't want visible, which we now use in the
  Nullness Checker to hide the @Primitive annotation.
- Nullness Checker:  Introduce a new internal qualifier @Primitive that is
  used for primitive types.
- Be stricter about qualifiers being present on all types. If you get
  errors about missing qualifiers, check your defaulting rules.
  This helped in fixing small bugs in corner cases of the type
  hierarchy and type factory.
- Unify decoding type annotations from trees and elements.
- Improve handling of annotations on type variables and upper bounds.
- Support checkers that use multiple, disjoint qualifier hierarchies.
- Many bug fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.3, 1 Nov 2011

Regex Checker:
- Add @PolyRegex polymorphic annotation
- Add more stub library annotations

Implementation details:
- Do not use "null" for unqualified types. Explicitly use @Unqualified
  and be strict about correct usage. If this causes trouble for you,
  check your @ImplicitFor and @DefaultQualifierInHierarchy
  meta-annotations and ensure correct defaulting in your
  AnnotatedTypeFactory.

Bug fixes:
- Correctly handle f-bounded polymorphism. AnnotatedTypeMirror now has
  methods to query the "effective" annotations on a type, which
  handles type variable and wildcard bounds correctly. Also, terminate
  recursions by not doing lazy-initialization of bounds during defaulting.
- Many other small bug fixes and documentation updates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.2, 1 Oct 2011

Be less restrictive about when to start type processing when errors
already exist.
Add -AskipDefs command-line option to not type-check some class
definitions.
Documentation improvements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.1, 20 Sep 2011

Fix issues 109, 110, 111 and various other cleanups.
Improvements to the release process.
Documentation improvements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.0.1, 4 Sep 2011

New version number to stay in sync with JSR 308 compiler bugfix.
No significant changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.0, 2 Sep 2011

Updated to JDK 8. Use -source 8 (the new default) for type annotations.
Documentation improvements
Bug fixes all over

Nullness Checker:
- Correct the upper bounds of all Collection subtypes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.5, 22 Jul 2011

Units Checker:
  Instead of conversion routines, provide unit constants, with which
  to multiply unqualified values. This is easier to type and the
  multiplication gets optimized away by the compiler.

Fenum Checker:
  Ensure that the switch statement expression is a supertype of all
  the case expressions.

Implementation details:

- Parse declaration annotations in stub files

- Output error messages instead of raising exceptions. This change
  required us to introduce method "initChecker" in class
  SourceChecker, which should be used instead of "init". This allows
  us to handle the calls to initChecker within the framework.
  Use method "errorAbort" to output an error message and abort
  processing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.4, 8 Jul 2011

Units Checker (new):
  Ensures operations are performed on variables of correct units of
  measurement (e.g., miles vs. kilometers vs. kilograms).

Changed -AskipClasses command-line option to -AskipUses

Implementation details:

- Improve support for type qualifiers with enum attributes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.3, 17 Jun 2011

Interning:
- Add @UsesObjectEquals annotation

Manual:
- Signature Checker is now documented
- Fenum Checker documentation improved
- Small improvements to other sections

Implementation details:

- Updates to the web-site build process

- The BaseTypeVisitor used to provide the same two type parameters as
  class SourceVisitor. However, all subtypes of BaseTypeVisitor were
  instantiated as <Void, Void>. We decided to directly instantiate the
  SourceVisitor as <Void, Void> and removed this complexity.
  Instead, the BaseTypeVisitor is now parameterized by the subtype of
  BaseTypeChecker that should be used. This gives a more concrete type
  to field "checker" and is similar to BasicAnnotatedTypeFactory.

- Added method AnnotatedTypeFactory.typeVariablesFromUse to allow type
  checkers to adapt the upper bounds of a type variable depending on
  the type instantiation.

- Method type argument inference:
  Changed AnnotatedTypeFactory.methodFromUse to return a Pair consisting
  of the method and the inferred or explicit method type arguments.
  If you override this method, you will need to update your version.
  See this change set for a simple example:
  http://code.google.com/p/checker-framework/source/detail?r=8381a213a4

- Testing framework:
  Support for multiple expected errors using the "//:: A :: B :: C" syntax.

Many small updates and fixes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.2, 12 Jan 2011

Fake Enum Checker (new):
  A "fake enumeration" is a set of integers rather than a proper Java enum.
  They are used in legacy code and for efficiency (e.g., in Android).  The
  Fake Enum Checker gives them the same safety guarantees as a proper Java
  enum.

Property File Checker (new):
  Ensures that valid keys are used for property files and resource bundles.
  Also includes a checker that code is properly internationalized and a
  checker for compiler message keys as used in the Checker Framework.

Signature Checker (new):
  Ensures that different string representations of a Java type (e.g.,
  "package.Outer.Inner" vs. "package.Outer$Inner" vs. "Lpackage/Outer$Inner;")
  are not misused.

Interning Checker enhancements:
  Issues fewer false positives for code like "a==b || a.equals(b)"

Foreign annotations:
  The Checker Framework supports more non-Checker-Framework annotations.
  This means that it can check already-annotated code without requiring you
  to rewrite your annotations.
    Add as an alias for checkers.interning.quals.Interned:
      com.sun.istack.Interned
    Add as aliases for checkers.nullness.quals.NonNull:
      com.sun.istack.NotNull
      org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.NonNull
    Add as aliases for checkers.nullness.quals.Nullable:
      com.sun.istack.Nullable
      javax.validation.constraints.NotNull
      org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.CheckForNull
      org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.NullAllowed
      org.netbeans.api.annotations.common.NullUnknown

Manual improvements:
  Improve installation instructions
  Rewrite section on generics (thanks to Bert Fernandez and David Cok)
    Also refactor the generics section into its own chapter
  Rewrite section on @Unused and @Dependent
  New manual section: Writing Java expressions as annotation arguments
  Better explanation of warning suppression
  JSR 308 is planned for Java 8, not Java 7

Stub files:
  Support nested classes by expressing them at top level in binary form: A$B
  Improved error reporting when parsing stub files

Annotated JDK:
  New way of generating annotated JDK
  jdk.jar file no longer appears in repository
  Warning if you are not using the annotated JDK.

Miscellaneous:
  Warn if -source command-line argument does not support type annotations

Many bug fixes
  There are too many to list, but some notable ones are to local type
  inference, generics, pre- and post-conditions (e.g., @NonNullOnEntry,
  @AssertNonNull*), and map keys (@KeyFor).  In particular, preconditions
  and map key annotations are now checked, and if they cannot be verified,
  an error is raised; previously, they were not verified, just unsoundly
  trusted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.1, 18 Sep 2010

Eclipse support:
  Removed the obsolete Eclipse plug-in from repository.  The new one uses a
  different repository
  (http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/checker-plugin/) but a user
  obtains it from the same URL as before:
  http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/eclipse/

Property Key Checker:
  The property key checker allows multiple resource bundles and the
  simultaneous use of both resource bundles and property files.

Javari Checker:
  Added Javari stub classes for more JDK classes.

Distribution:
  Changed directory structure (top level is "checker-framework"; "checkers"
  is a under that) for consistency with version control repository.

Many documentation improvements and minor bugfixes.

    "extends @NonNull Object"  

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.3, 5 Dec 2009

Checkers
  New location UPPER_BOUND for DefaultQualifier permits setting the default
    for upper bounds, such as Object in "? extends Object".
  @DefaultQualifier accepts simple names, like @DefaultQualifier("Nullable"),
    rather than requiring @DefaultQualifier("checkers.nullness.quals.Nullable").
  Local variable type inference has improved support for array accesses.
  The repository contains Eclipse project and launch configuration files.
    This is helpful too people who want to build a checker, not to people
    who merely want to run a checker.
  Many bug fixes, including:
    handling wildcard subtyping rules
    stub files and vararg methods being ignored
    nullness and spurious rawness errors
    uses of array clone method (e.g. String[].clone())
