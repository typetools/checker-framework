These two classes illustrate dependencies between different
compilation units.
As of 09/06/2011 these generated two different exceptions in the
compiler.
Both of those are fixed, but we should investigate further whether all
similar cases are correctly handled now. TODO!

If the two classes are compiled individually or in the superclass then
subclass order:

runcheckers-jdk7.sh -processor checkers.nullness.NullnessChecker Bug109_A.java Bug109_B.java 

everything works as expected.
If they are compiled in the subclass then superclass order:

runcheckers-jdk7.sh -processor checkers.nullness.NullnessChecker Bug109_B.java Bug109_A.java 

the compiler used to throw exceptions.
These two problems are now fixed.
The problem was that AnnotatedTypeFactory.getAnnotatedType looks at a
field initializer to determine its type. When the field was in a
different class, this lead to a call of getPath with a tree in a
different compilation unit, which cannot be handled.
We now conservatively return null sooner.
