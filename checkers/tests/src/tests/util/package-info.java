 * A minimal checker and simple annotation used for testing the checkers

 *
 * The checker and annotation in this package should only be used for testing.

 *
 * The {@code @Odd} annotation is a straightforward subtype-style qualifier.
 * It has no special semantics; values that do not have an {@code @Odd} type
 * cannot be assigned to values that do have the {@code @Odd} type.
