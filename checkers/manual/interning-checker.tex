\chapter{Interning checker\label{interning-checker}}

If the Interning checker issues no warnings for a given program, then all
reference equality tests (i.e., all uses of ``\code{==}'') are proper;
\code{==} is not misused where \code{equals()} should have been used instead.

Interning is a design pattern in which the same object is used whenever two
different objects would be considered equal.  Interning is also known as
canonicalization or hash-consing, and it is related to the flyweight design
pattern.
Interning has two benefits:  it can save memory, and it can speed up testing for
equality by permitting use of \code{==}.

The Interning checker prevents two types of errors in your code.  First, 
\code{==} should be used
only on interned values; using \code{==} on
non-interned values can result in subtle bugs.  For example:

\begin{Verbatim}
  Integer x = new Integer(22);
  Integer y = new Integer(22);
  System.out.println(x == y);  // prints false!
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The Interning checker helps programmers to prevent such bugs.
Second, 
the Interning checker also helps to prevent performance problems that result
from failure to use interning.
(See Section~\ref{checker-guarantees} for caveats to the checker's guarantees.)

Interning is such an important design pattern that Java builds it in for
strings.  Every string literal in the program is guaranteed to be interned
(\ahref{http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third\_edition/html/lexical.html\#3.10.5}{JLS
  \S3.10.5}), and the
\sunjavadoc{java/lang/String.html#intern()}{String.intern()} method
performs interning for strings that are computed at run time.
Users can also write their own interning methods for other types.

It is a proper optimization to use \code{==}, rather than \code{equals()},
whenever the comparison is guaranteed to produce the same result --- that
is, whenever the comparison is never provided with two different objects
for which \code{equals()} would return true.  Here are three reasons that
this property could hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Interning.  A factory method ensures that, globally, no two different
  interned objects are \code{equals()} to one another.  (In some cases
  other, non-interned objects of the class might be \code{equals()} to one
  another; in other cases, every object of the class is interned.)
  Interned objects should always be immutable.
\item
  Global control flow.  The program's control flow is such that the
  constructor for class $C$ is called a limited number of times, and with
  specific values that ensure the results are not \code{equals()} to one
  another.  Objects of class $C$ can always be compared with \code{==}.
  Such objects may be mutable or immutable.
\item
  Local control flow.  Even though not all objects of the given type may be
  compared with \code{==}, the specific objects that can reach a given
  comparison may be.  For example, suppose that an array contains no
  duplicates.  Then testing to find the index of a given element that is
  known to be in the array can use \code{==}.
\end{enumerate}

To eliminate Interning Checker warnings, you will need to annotate your
code regarding all legal uses of \code{==}.  Thus, the Interning Checker
should perhaps have been called the Reference Equality Checker.  In the
future, the checker will include annotations that target the non-interning
cases above, but for now you need to use \<@Interned> and/or
\<@SuppressWarnings>.

To run the Interning Checker, supply the \code{-processor
  checkers.interning.InterningChecker} command-line option to javac.  For
examples, see Section~\ref{interning-example}.


\section{Interning annotations\label{interning-annotations}}

Two qualifiers are part of the Interning type system.

\begin{description}

\item[\code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}}]
  indicates a type that includes only interned values (no non-interned
  values).

\item[\<@\refclass{interning/quals}{PolyInterned}>]
  indicates qualifier polymorphism.  For a description of
  \<@\refclass{interning/quals}{PolyInterned}>, see
  Section~\ref{qualifier-polymorphism}.

\end{description}


\section{Annotating your code with \code{@Interned}\label{annotating-with-interned}}

\begin{figure}
\includeimage{interning}{2.5cm}
\caption{Type hierarchy for the Interning type system.}
\label{fig:interning-hierarchy}
\end{figure}

In order to perform checking, you must annotate your code with the \code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}}
type annotation, which indicates a type for the canonical representation of an
object:

\begin{Verbatim}
            String s1 = ...;  // type is (uninterned) "String"
  @Interned String s2 = ...;  // Java type is "String", but checker treats it as "Interned String"
\end{Verbatim}

The type system enforced by the checker plugin ensures that only interned
values can be assigned to \code{s2}.

To specify that \emph{all} objects of a given type are interned, annotate the
class declaration:

\begin{Verbatim}
  public @Interned class MyInternedClass { ... }
\end{Verbatim}

This is equivalent to annotating every use of \code{MyInternedClass}, in a
declaration or elsewhere.  For example, \code{enum} classes are implicitly
so annotated.


\subsection{Implicit qualifiers\label{interning-implicit-qualifiers}}

As described in Section~\ref{effective-qualifier}, the Interning checker
adds implicit qualifiers, reducing the number of annotations that must
appear in your code.
For example, String literals and the null literal are always considered interned, and
object creation expressions (using \code{new}) are never considered
\code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}} unless they are annotated as such, as in

%BEGIN LATEX
\begin{smaller}
%END LATEX
\begin{Verbatim}
@Interned Double internedDoubleZero = new @Interned Double(0); // canonical representation for Double zero
\end{Verbatim}
%BEGIN LATEX
\end{smaller}
%END LATEX

For a complete description of all implicit interning qualifiers, see the
Javadoc for \refclass{interning}{InterningAnnotatedTypeFactory}.


\section{What the Interning checker checks\label{interning-checks}}

Objects of an \code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}} type may be safely compared using the ``\code{==}''
operator.

The checker issues a warning in two cases:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  When a reference (in)equality operator (``\code{==}'' or ``\code{!=}'')
  has an operand of non-\code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}} type.

\item
  When a non-\code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}} type is used where an \code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}} type
  is expected.

\end{enumerate}

This example shows both sorts of problems:

\begin{Verbatim}
            Object  obj;
  @Interned Object iobj;
  ...
  if (obj == iobj) { ... }  // checker warning: reference equality test is unsafe
  iobj = obj;               // checker warning: iobj's referent may no longer be interned
\end{Verbatim}

\label{lint-dotequals}

The checker also issues a warning when \code{.equals} is used where
\code{==} could be safely used.  You can disable this behavior via the
javac \code{-Alint} command-line option, like so: \code{-Alint=-dotequals}.

For a complete description of all checks performed by
  the checker, see the Javadoc for
  \refclass{interning}{InterningVisitor}.

\label{checking-class}
You can also restrict which types the checker should examine and type-check,
using the \code{-Acheckclass} option.  For example, to find only the
interning errors related to uses of \code{String}, you can pass
\code{-Acheckclass=java.lang.String}.  The Interning checker always checks all
subclasses and superclasses of the given class.


\section{Examples\label{interning-example}}

To try the Interning checker on a source file that uses the \code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}} qualifier,
use the following command (where \code{javac} is the JSR 308 compiler that
is distributed with the Checker Framework):

\begin{Verbatim}
  javac -processor checkers.interning.InterningChecker examples/InterningExample.java
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
Compilation will complete without warnings.

To see the checker warn about incorrect usage of annotations, use the following
command:

\begin{Verbatim}
  javac -processor checkers.interning.InterningChecker examples/InterningExampleWithWarnings.java
\end{Verbatim}

\noindent
The compiler will issue a warning regarding violation of the semantics of
\code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}}.
% in the \code{InterningExampleWithWarnings.java} file.


The Daikon invariant detector
(\myurl{http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/daikon/}) is also annotated with
\code{@\refclass{interning/quals}{Interned}}.  From directory \code{java},
run \code{make check-interning}.



\section{Other interning annotations\label{other-interning-annotations}}

The Checker Framework's interning annotations are similar to annotations used
elsewhere.

If your code is already annotated with a different interning
annotation, you can reuse that effort by converting them to the Checker
Framework's nullness annotations.  Perform the refactoring described in
Figure~\ref{fig:interning-refactoring}.


% These lists should be kept in sync with InterningAnnotatedTypeFactory.java .

\end{figure}

Alternately, the Checker Framework can process those other annotations (as
well as its own, if they also appear in your program).  The Checker
Framework has its own definition of the annotations on the left side of
Figure~\ref{fig:interning-refactoring}, so that they can be used as type
qualifiers.  The Checker Framework interprets them according to the right
side of Figure~\ref{fig:interning-refactoring}.
