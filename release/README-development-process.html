        <p>This document describes the process and timeline for a Checker Framework development milestone.
        The important deadlines are described as well as what happens when a deadline is missed.
        A checklist is also provided of things a release person must do. If you are a release person,
        please read this document in its entirety once, and in future releases you may read only the
        checklist each time. <strong>If you make changes to this document, make sure changes a release person
        must know about are included in the checklist.</strong> Additional background or reference information
        may be added to the other sections.</p>

        <p>If you are not a release person and just wish to understand the development process, please
        skip to this <a href="#phases">section</a>.</p>

        <h3>Checklist of steps a release person must follow</h3>

        <ol>
           <li>Throughout the release:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Triage incoming Checker Framework bugs (daily or as they come in). Ensure each bug is assigned to the right person
                      and has been given a priority.</li>
                  <li>Keep track of bugs being resolved to ensure that there is a reproducible test case for them.</li>
               </ul>
           <li>First day of the development milestone:</li>
               <ul>
                   <li>Plan the feature freeze, code freeze and release dates for the following two months, and send an e-mail to the
                       checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev mailing lists with these dates.
                       Also please make sure to add these dates to the "Checker Framework Developers" Google Calendar.
                       We should aim to release on the first business day of the month. Whenever possible, avoid releasing
                       near the end of a month instead of the beginning of the next month, as that makes it easier for users
                       to keep track of the cadence of our releases (e.g. having a June 1st and a June 30th release makes
                       it harder to tell that the June 30th release is meant for distribution in the month of July).</li>
               </ul>
           <li>One week before Feature Freeze:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Remind bug owners of their bugs outstanding.</li>
               </ul>
           <li>Two business days before Feature Freeze:</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>E-mail checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev reminding
                  users of the upcoming Feature Freeze and the requirements for this deadline, including
                  the requirement for changelogs to be complete.</li>
               </ul>
           <li>The work morning after Feature Freeze:</li>
               <ul>
                   <li>Ensure that all <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/CF%20Release/">the Jenkins projects
                   under &quot;CF Release&quot;</a> are green and notify owners of the
                   test projects if this is not the case.</li>
                   <li>Ensure that all
                   <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/CF%20Release/">the Jenkins projects under &quot;CF Release&quot;</a>
                   do not have performance regressions compared to the previous release (this list may be narrowed down to fewer
                   projects in the future). If a performance regression was introduced, work with the feature owner to understand
                   whether bug fixes can fix the performance regression and to decide on the appropriate action.</li>
                   <li>Ensure that
                   the changelogs for the Checker Framework, Type Annotations Compiler and AFU are complete.
                   E-mail Mike asking him to vet the changelogs
                   that are checked in.</li>
                   <li>Verify that the lists of checkers in these chapter sections are up to date:</li>
                       <ul>
                           <li><a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checker-framework-manual.html#introduction">Introduction</a></li>

                       </ul>
                   <li>Add any new checkers to the Eclipse plug-in.</li>
                   <li>E-mail checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev reminding
                   users of the upcoming Code Freeze and the requirements for this deadline.</li>
               </ul>
           <li>The work morning after Code Freeze:</li>
               <ul>
                   <li>Ensure that all <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/CF%20Release/">the Jenkins projects
                   under &quot;CF Release&quot;</a> are green and notify owners of the
                   test projects if this is not the case.</li>
                   <li>Ensure that all
                   <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/CF%20Release/">the Jenkins projects under &quot;CF Release&quot;</a>
                   do not have performance regressions compared to the previous release (this list may be narrowed down to fewer
                   projects in the future). If a performance regression was introduced, work with the bug fix owner and Mike to
                   decide whether to back
                   out the bug fix, ship with the performance regression, or delay the release to
                   address the performance issue.</li>
                   <li>If the above items are taken care of, <a href="README-maintainers.html">perform the release</a>.</li>
               </ul>

        </ol>

        <h3>Recommendations/notes for the release person</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>As the release person, consider pushing your bug fixes at least two days prior to the code freeze deadline - this is because you
            are likely to be helping other people make their Jenkins projects become green during those two days.</li>
            <li>The reason Mike must be asked to look at the changelogs right after feature freeze (instead of
            code freeze) is that there no longer is a "recall class" bug fix period, so there are now only two
            days between feature freeze and the release.
            This ensures that there are no delays in releasing the products (due to
            incomplete changelogs) or in sending the announcement e-mail.
            If during the bug fixing period anyone fixes a bug that is worth mentioning as more
            than a number, the changelog can be amended accordingly and Mike can be warned about it.</li>
            <li><strong>A note on release version numbers:</strong> It is <em>strongly discouraged </em>to not
            update the release version numbers for the Checker Framework and jsr308-langtools even if no changes
            were made to these in a month. This would break so much in the release scripts that they would
            become unusable. For the AFU, it is recommended to include a small bug fix or doc update in every
            release so the version number can be updated, but when that is not possible, the release person must:
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure that they are subscribed to the AFU push notifications mailing list.</li>
                <li>Verify that the AFU changelog has not been changed.</li>
                <li>Grep all the AFU pages on the dev web site for the release date with patterns such as "29.*Aug"
                and "Aug.*29" and fix them to match the previous release date.</li>
            </ul>
            Keep in mind that in this case, the release scripts will fail in certain places and the release person
            must manually follow a few remaining release steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Description of the phases and deadlines</h3>
        <p><mark style="background-color: #6d9de9">Development</p>
        <p>During the development phase, arbitrarily large or complex changes may be pushed.</p>
        <p><font color="blue">Feature freeze</font></p>
        <p>By the <em>feature freeze </em>deadline, all new feature code, associated tests, and documentation
        must be pushed. If a feature is not complete by this time, then it should be delayed until the next
        release. By this time, all users should update the relevant project&rsquo;s changelog to include
        features and bug fixes they have made during this development cycle (not including bug fixes made
        in the two days that follow).</p>
        <p><mark style="background-color: #92c27d">Bug fixing</p>
        <p>During this phase general bugs are fixed. These are minor bugs that may have been discovered
        (by the new tests or otherwise) in the feature implementation or documentation. You are allowed
        to fix any bug that you want, add new tests and documentation, etc., during this time. But no
        new features may be implemented. Example bugs that would be fixed during this phase is anything
        that is revealed by Jenkins but was not revealed by the test suite itself.</p>
        <p><font color="#6aa74f">Code freeze</font></p>
        <p>By <em>code freeze</em>, the code is assumed to be in a shippable state. Pushes to the
        repository are no longer allowed.</p>
        <p><mark style="background-color: #d0e0e3">Release</p>
        <p>The person responsible for making the release runs the release scripts and other manual tasks
        for the release (note that any pushes during this phase force the automated tests to restart and
        possibly delay the release.)</p>
        <h3>Deadline enforcement</h3>
        <p>The following are only enforced for the main (release) branch:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any large or complex change (i.e. a feature change or a design change) pushed after
            feature freeze will be reverted.</li>
            <li>Any fix for a bug pushed after code freeze for which an exception was not made will be reverted.</li>
            <li>If a recall class bug is discovered late and its fix is not checked in with enough time
            for Jenkins tests to complete before Release Day, <strong>then the release is delayed</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
