    <h2>Checker Framework Development Process</h2>
    <p>This document describes the process and timeline for a Checker Framework development milestone.
    The important deadlines are described as well as what happens when a deadline is missed.
    A checklist is also provided of things a release person must do. If you are a release person,
    please read this document in its entirety once, and in future releases you may read only the
    checklist each time. <strong>If you make changes to this document, make sure changes a release person
    must know about are included in the checklist.</strong> Background or reference information
    may be added to the other sections.</p>

    <p>If you are not a release person and just wish to understand the development process, please
    skip to this <a href="#phases">section</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="checklist">Checklist of steps a release person must follow</h3>

    <ol>
       <li>First day of the development milestone:
         <ul>
           <li>If you have not done so before, follow the steps in the <a href="README-maintainers.html#pre_release_checklist">Pre-release Checklist</a>
           in the Release Process document. These steps are important not just for the work performed on release day but
           also for other work perfomed throughout the release. Some of these steps can take days to complete as they
           involve obtaining permissions to access projects on various web sites.</li>
           <li>Plan the feature freeze, code freeze and release dates for the following two months, and send an e-mail to the
             checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev mailing lists with these dates.
             Also please make sure to add these dates to the "Checker Framework Developers" Google Calendar.
             We should aim to release on the first business day of the month. Whenever possible, avoid releasing
             near the end of a month instead of the beginning of the next month, as that makes it easier for users
             to keep track of the cadence of our releases (e.g. having a June 1st and a June 30th release makes
             it harder to tell that the June 30th release is meant for distribution in the month of July).</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>One week before Feature Freeze:
         <ul>
          <li>Remind bug owners of their bugs outstanding.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Two business days before Feature Freeze:
         <ul>
          <li>E-mail checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev reminding
          users of the upcoming Feature Freeze and the requirements for this deadline, including
          the requirement for changelogs to be complete.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>The work morning after Feature Freeze:
         <ul>
           <li>Ensure that all the <a href="README-maintainers.html#continuous-integration">continuous integration jobs</a> are passing.</li>
           <li>Ensure that
           the changelogs and documentation for the Checker Framework, Type Annotations Compiler and AFU are complete by following
           <a href="README-maintainers.html#step_by_step">these instructions</a> up to and including the &quot;Review the changelogs and documentation&quot; step.
           <li>E-mail Mike asking him to vet the changelogs
           that are checked in.</li>
           <li>E-mail checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev reminding
           users of the upcoming Code Freeze and the requirements for this deadline.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>The work morning after Code Freeze:
         <ul>
           <li>Ensure that all the <a
           href="README-maintainers.html#continuous-integration">continuous
           integration jobs</a> are passing.</li>
           <li>If the above items are taken care of, <a href="README-maintainers.html">perform the release</a>.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Recommendations/notes for the release person</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>As the release person, consider pushing your bug fixes at least two days prior to the code freeze deadline &mdash; this is because you
      are likely to be helping other people make their Jenkins projects become green during those two days.</li>
      <li>The reason Mike must be asked to look at the changelogs right after feature freeze (instead of
      code freeze) is that there no longer is a "recall class" bug fix period, so there is now only one
      working day between feature freeze and the release.
      This ensures that there are no delays in releasing the products (due to
      incomplete changelogs) or in sending the announcement e-mail.
      If during the bug fixing period anyone fixes a bug that is worth mentioning as more
      than a number, the changelog can be amended accordingly and Mike can be warned about it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Description of the phases and deadlines</h3>
    <p style="background-color: #6d9de9">Development</p>
    <p>During the development phase, arbitrarily large or complex changes may be pushed.</p>
    <p style="background-color:blue">Feature freeze</p>
    <p>By the <em>feature freeze </em>deadline, all new feature code, associated tests, and documentation
    must be pushed. If a feature is not complete by this time, then it should be delayed until the next
    release. By this time, all users should update the relevant project&rsquo;s changelog to include
    features and bug fixes they have made during this development cycle (not including bug fixes made
    in the day that follows).</p>
    <p style="background-color: #92c27d">Bug fixing</p>
    <p>During this phase bugs are fixed, including minor bugs that may have been discovered
    (by the new tests or otherwise) in the feature implementation or documentation. You are allowed
    to fix any bug that you want, add new tests and documentation, etc., during this time. But no
    new features may be implemented. Example bugs that would be fixed during this phase are bugs
    revealed by Jenkins that were not revealed by the test suites that were run before pushing a feature.</p>
    <p style="color:#6aa74f">Code freeze</p>
    <p>By <em>code freeze</em>, the code is assumed to be in a shippable state. Pushes to the
    repository are no longer allowed.</p>
    <p style="background-color: #d0e0e3">Release</p>
    <p>The person responsible for making the release runs the release scripts and other manual tasks
    for the release (note that any pushes during this phase force the automated tests to restart and
    are likely to delay the release).</p>
    <h3>Deadline enforcement</h3>
    <p>The following are only enforced for the 'master' branch from which the release is performed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any large or complex change (i.e. a feature change or a design change) pushed after
      feature freeze will be reverted.</li>
      <li>Any fix for a bug pushed after code freeze for which an exception was not made will be reverted.</li>
      <li>If a critical bug is discovered late and its fix is not checked in with enough time
      for Jenkins tests to complete before Release Day, <strong>then the release is delayed</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
