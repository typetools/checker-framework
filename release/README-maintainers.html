  This document explains how to make a release of the Checker Framework, the Type Annotations Compiler,
  and the Annotation File Utilities.
The process takes around 3 hours (including manual steps) when all goes according to plan.
  However, the lengthiest steps are automatic so you will be able to work on other tasks.
</p>
<p><strong>See also</strong> the <a href="README-development-process.html">Checker Framework Development Process</a> document which explains
the steps a release person should follow over the course of an entire development milestone.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
  <strong>Note:</strong> If you have never read this document before, please read
  the section <a href="#pre_release_checklist">Pre-release Checklist</a> first.
  It is also recommended that you read sections  <a href="#release_process_overview">Release Process Overview</a>
  and <a href="#changelog_guide">Changelog Guidelines</a> to familiarize yourself
  with the process.
</div>

<section id="step_by_step">
<h2>Step by Step</h2>

<p>
  More information about the steps is
  provided in the code comments of the <code>main()</code> functions of the <code>release_build</code>
  and <code>release_push</code> scripts. Please read those comments if you have never done so before.
</p>

<p>
Answering 'no' to a prompt does not exit the script unless otherwise indicated.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to carefully read all instructions on the command-line before answering 'yes' to a prompt.
This is because the scripts do not ask you to say 'yes' after each step, so you may
miss a step if you only read the paragraph asking you to say 'yes'.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you have never made a release before, follow the instructions in the
  <a href="#pre_release_checklist">Pre-release Checklist</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Download and install the lastest version of Eclipse.  Check that the Eclipse version
      matches the version listed in
      <a href="../eclipse/checker-framework-eclipse-update-site/manual/index.html#installation">the Eclipse plugin manual</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Log into Buffalo</strong><br/>
      <code>ssh $USER@buffalo.cs.washington.edu<br/></code>
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>In a user-specific temporary directory, clone/update the Checker Framework repository (it contains the release scripts).</strong><br/>
      <code>mkdir -p /scratch/$USER/jsr308-release<br/></code>
      <code>cd /scratch/$USER/jsr308-release<br/></code>
      <code>git -C checker-framework pull --quiet || git clone --quiet https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework.git<br/></code>
      <code>cd checker-framework/release<br/></code>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Review the changelogs and documentation</strong><br/>
      Ensure that the changelogs and documentation for the Checker Framework, Type Annotations Compiler and
      AFU are complete.  First follow the instructions at <a href="#content_guidelines">content guidelines</a>.  Then,
      run release_build in a mode that reviews the documentation only:
      <code>cd /scratch/$USER/jsr308-release/checker-framework/release<br/></code>
      <code>python release_build.py all --review-manual</code><br/><br/>
      <strong>Note:</strong> This step can be performed in advance of the release day. It is recommended
      that this be done the work morning after Feature Freeze.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Run release_build</strong><br/>
      <code>python release_build.py all --auto</code><br/><br/>
      For verbose debugging output, use the <code>--debug</code> option.<br/><br/>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;all&quot; argument specifies that all projects should be built.
      There has been some work done in order to select only specific projects (JSR 308 compiler, AFU, Checker Framework)
      to be built but more work still needs to be done.  Just pass &quot;all&quot; for now.
      See also <a href="#fi_buffalo_integeration">Buffalo Integration</a> for more information
      on the option &quot;--auto&quot;, which you can omit in order to
      be asked more questions during the build.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Run release_push</strong><br/>
      <code>python release_push.py release</code><br/><br/>
      For minimal prompting, use the <code>--auto</code> option.<br/><br/>
      <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;<strong>release</strong>&quot; argument states that you intend
        to do an actual release.  If you just want to test the script, leave out &quot;release&quot;
        and the script will run but not update anything.
      </div>

      If you get an obscure error about permissions, try running the release_push script several times
      in a row. This will sometimes update the repository permissions such that the script can proceed
      further each time.
  </li>

  <h2>Continuous integration (nightly) tests</h2>

  <p>
    The following continuous integration tests should all pass before you make changes that you need to test.  If not, notify the
    relevant team members.

  <li>All <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/view/CF%20Release/">the Jenkins projects

           should not have performance regressions compared to the previous release (this list may be narrowed down to fewer
           projects in the future). Open the <a href="http://tern.cs.washington.edu:8080/plugin/global-build-stats/">Global Build Stats</a>
           page (you will be prompted for your Jenkins credentials if you are not logged in). The charts may take a few seconds
           to load. For each project, look at the average build time in recent days and in days approximately 30 days ago,
           and look for any differences in the trend.</li>

          test various components.

  <h2>Changelog Guidelines</h2>
  <p> Each developer is responsible for updating project changelogs to reflect changes they
    have made each month.  The changelogs should be updated by "feature freeze" though at the
    latest this should be done before "code freeze".  Before releasing, the person performing
    the release will be asked to verify the changelogs.  Please check that
    there aren't typos (i.e. missing release date/version information, spelling errors, etc...).
    Also check that the changelog obeys the guidelines below.

    <h3>Style Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Changes are written from the user's perspective.  Don't include implementation details that users
        don't care about.
      </li>
      <li>To be consistent, write in the past tense (e.g. &quot;Added option for verbose error messages&quot;).</li>
      <li>Lines should not exceed 80 characters wide.</li>
      <li>Break the different programs into their own sections.  See notes on release 1.7.0 and 1.5.0 for an
        example.  Things like the Eclipse plugin and Maven plugin should have their own section within the
        Checker Framework release notes (excluding issue fixes from the issue tracker).
      </li>
      <li>Be specific.  Don't write something like "added a few options to Eclipse plugin".  Do write "added
        options to the Eclipse plugin to include stub files, ignore warnings, and show verbose output."

<section id="backing_out">
  <h2>Backing Out an Uncommitted Release</h2>
  <p>At the time of this writing, there are 2 steps that cannot be reverted.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The push from the interm repositories to the GitHub/Bitbucket (release) repositories</li>
    <li>The release of the staged Maven artifacts</li>
  </ol>
  <p> If you have executed either of these steps and then realized there is a breaking error, you should do another
    release.  The release script will allow you to do a point release like &quot;1.8.0.1&quot; when a version
    &quot;1.8.0&quot; already exists.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you have NOT committed an irreversible step then you can
    follow the steps below to point the live release to a previous release.  You can then redo the original
    release.  Make sure to say &quot;yes&quot; when the release script asks you to delete the old directories.
  </p>
  <h3>Manual Steps to Back Out a Release</h3>
  <ul id="backing_out_steps">
    <li><strong>Point symlinks to old release</strong><br/>
      For each project (JSR 308 compiler, Annotation File Utilities, Checker Framework), find the
      version for the previous release. <br/>
      In each project's top-level website directory (e.g. /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/):
      delete the symlink &quot;current&quot; (or use the force option of ln) and point it to the
      release directory of the previous release.  E.g.<br/>
      <code>ln -sf /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/releases/1.7.5 /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/current</code>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Drop the artifacts from Central</strong><br/>
      You may have staged and then closed the artifacts in the Sonatypes Central repository.  Drop (do NOT release)
      these artifacts.  See
      <a href="https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-DroppingaStagingRepository%28i.e.WhattoDoifYourStagingRepositoryHasErrors%29">
        the Sonatypes OSS Repository Usage Guidelines.
      </a>
    </li>
    <!-- <li><strong>Drop the Maven Artifacts from our Maven repo *** currently unneeded ***</strong>
      <p class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Note:</strong> The procedure below is NOT recommended
        by the Maven developers guide.  However, if done carefully and quickly no harm will likely
        come.  If people end up with out-of-date artifacts, recommend to them that they use the -U option
        in Maven 3.  Never follow these instructions if the plugin release has been publicized or
        existed for a while.
      </p>

      At the moment, we have decided to drop the user of our local Maven repository in favor of using
      the Central repository exclusively.  This may not be the case in the future.  If we do have a
      local repository, you need to go into the repositories directory (usually an m2-repo directory) and
      manually delete the versions of the Maven artifacts.  For instance, for the artifacts checker and compiler
      using version 0.9.8, I would delete the directories:
      <ul>
        <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/checker/0.9.8</li>
        <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/compiler/0.9.8</li>
      </ul>
      Furthermore, I would grep the files in the parents of these directories and ensure the version number
      does not appear in any metadata.  If so, fix up the metadata.
    </li> -->
  </ul>

  <p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Note:</strong> You may find yourself copying release directories for some
    reason or other.  It is important to remember that the symlinks may be absolute.  You should check any
    symlinks that may be affected by the move and ensure they point to the new location and not the old one.
  </p>

<section id="future_improvements">
  <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
  <p>Below is a roughly priority-ordered list of future improvements.  In a perfect world we would do
    all of these.  At the moment, I believe only the first 2 (Open JDK Javadoc Fixes,
    and More Sanity Checks) should have any appreciable priority.
  </p>

  <section id="fi_jdk-api_fixup">
    <h3>Open JDK/JSR308 Javadoc</h3>
    Generating the Javadocs for the entire JDK is not simple.  We have previously generated these but have
    not updated them in a while.  They can be found here:<br/>
    <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/jdk-api/">http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/jdk-api/</a><br/>
    When we generate javadoc for the Type Annotations Compiler and Checker Framework we link against these docs.
    But because they were generated in a faulty manner in the first place, there are many broken links related to
    package summaries of the jdk-api docs.  It is highly unlikely that users will ever run into these links, since
    they occur in pages like Swing's package summary, but nonetheless it would be good to build these docs
    in the proper manner with no broken links.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Figure out the best way to build the Open JDK Javadoc.</li>
      <li>Add a release script step to build the Open JDK Javadoc.</li>
      <li>Add a release script step to copy this javadoc to /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/jdk-api.</li>
      <li>We may also want to put jdk-api into the release directory instead of overwriting it during each release.</li>
      <li>Update this document to reflect the new steps.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="fi_more_sanity_checks">
    <h3>More Sanity Checks</h3>
    There are likely more sanity checks we might want to run during the release process.  One such example
    would be running the tutorial from the command line.  Another would be running the maven plugin using
    the released artifacts rather than the staged artifacts.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement one of the sanity checks mentioned in this section.</li>
      <li>Add your sanity check to the appropriate location in the release_push script.</li>
      <li>Update this document to reflect the new steps.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sanity Checks:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Maven plugin using the released Central repository.</li>
      <li>Run tutorial sanity check automatically via command line.</li>
      <li>Eclipse auto-sanity check see <a href="#fi_automate_eclipse_build">Automate the Eclipse Build.</a></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="fi_buffalo_integeration">
    <h3>Buffalo Integration</h3>
    If we could have Buffalo run the release_build script nightly, we could head off broken links and other
    release related errors.  There is an &quot;--auto&quot; option for this specific reason but a number of
    errors start happening when we run the script from Buffalo.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a Buffalo task to run the release_buld script using the &quot;--auto&quot; option.</li>
      <li>Observe the output of this task and identify possible errors.</li>
      <li>Fix up all observed errors until the release_build script runs without error.</li>
      <li>We probably want to move the link checking of the development site to the release_build script and
        write it out to disk.  This will allow the developer releasing the framework to consult pre-made
        link-checking results rather than waiting for the link checker to execute in the push script.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="fi_auto-copy_release_scripts">
    <h3>Auto-copy Release Scripts</h3>
    The first step in running the release process, after the pre-release checklist, is to copy the
    release scripts into the jsr308-release directory.  We could automate this.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a read-only script in jsr308-release/scripts.</li>
      <li>Edit the script so that it downloads all release scripts into the jsr308-release directory.</li>
      <li>Update this document to reflect this new process.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="fi_option_parsing">
    <h3>Option Parsing</h3>
    There is currently some primitive option parsing written into the release scripts.  We should use
    Python's built-in option parsing library.  There are multiple built-in libraries.  Please use the latest one.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Look up the latest Python parsing library.</li>
      <li>Replace the option parsing in the release_build.py and release_push.py scripts with library calls.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="fi_option_projects">
    <h3>Optional Projects</h3>
    A user might want to test the release_build script only on a specific project.  Some work has gone into
    the ability to select a project to build.  However, this currently doesn't take into consideration of dependencies.
    It might be more hassle than it's worth to implement this feature.  We should either complete the implementation
    or remove the partial implementation that already exists.  See <a href="#fi_repl_mode">REPL Mode</a>.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve option parsing to allow the user to select only certain projects to build.</li>
      <li>Improve scripts to resolve dependencies between projects and only build the selected projects and
        their dependencies.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="fi_repl_mode">
    <h3>REPL Mode</h3>
    The current script is built in an imperative style with little use of object orientation.  This improvement
    would create methods or objects that further encapsulate the current set of steps.  We could then provide
    an easy way to execute these steps from the Python REPL.  This would allow the user to execute individual steps
    in whatever order they saw fit from the Python REPL.  This could also be used to
    automatically back out the current release or the ability to edit/debug the release steps more easily.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Further separate the steps of the release process.</li>
      <li>Provide a default parameterization for these steps to make them easily runnable from the
        command line. </li>
      <li>Provide a script to launch Python with these commands on its path.</li>
      <li>Update this README to document the new functionality.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="fi_automate_eclipse_build">
    <h3>Automate the Eclipse Build</h3>
    The Checker Framework Eclipse plugin is the cause of the most burdensome manual steps in the release
    process.  There exist ways to automate the plugin build and tests.  However, the process is complicated and
    would take a while to perfect.  It may or may not be worth it.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Ant or other methods to automate the Eclipse build.</li>
      <li>Add to the release script targets for updating version numbers and other relevant fields
        of the Eclipse plugin for the release.
      </li>
      <li>Add a step(s) to build/test the Eclipse plugin from the command line to the release script.</li>
      <li>Update this README to include the new steps.</li>
