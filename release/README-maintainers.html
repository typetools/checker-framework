    This document explains how to make a release of the Checker Framework, the Type Annotations Compiler,
    and the Annotation File Utilities.  In general the process consists of 4 steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Upload the latest release scripts to Buffalo.</li>
    <li>Log into Buffalo.</li>
    <li>Run the build script.</li>
    <li>Run the push script.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Together, the release_build/release_push scripts take around 3 hours (including manual steps) when all goes according to plan.
    However, the most lengthy steps are automatic so you will be able to work on other tasks.

    <strong>Note:</strong> If you have never read this document before, please read
    the section <a href="#pre_release_checklist">Pre-release Checklist</a> first.
    It is also recommended that you read sections  <a href="#release_process_overview">Release Process Overview</a>
    and <a href="#changelog_guide">Changelog Guidelines</a> to familiarize yourself
    with the process.
</div>

<section id="step_by_step">
<h2>Step by Step</h2>

<p> A brief description of the release steps is given below. For the most part you should just
    be able to run the commands below manually and follow the prompts. More information is
    provided in the code comments of the <code>main()</code> functions of the <code>release_build</code>
    and <code>release_push</code> scripts. Please read those comments if you have never done so before.
</p>

<p><b>Summary of steps:</b></p>
<p class="well">
    <code>
        scp -r $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/release/* $USER@buffalo.cs.washington.edu:///scratch/jsr308-release/scripts<br/>
        ssh $USER@buffalo.cs.washington.edu<br/>
        cd /scratch/jsr308-release/scripts<br/>
        python release_build.py all<br/>
        python release_push.py<br/>
    </code>

    <br/>
</p>
<p>If you have not run the scripts before, please review the steps below.</p>

<b>Note that many prompts will cause scripts to exit if you say 'no'.</b> This will require you to re-run
the script from the beginning, which may take a long time.  It is better to say 'yes' to
the script prompts and follow the indicated steps even if they are redundant/you have done them
already. Also, be sure to carefully read all instructions on the command-line before typing yes.
This is because the scripts do not ask you to say 'yes' after each step, so you may
miss a step if you only read the paragraph asking you to say 'yes'.

            Until the improvement <a href="#fi_auto-copy_release_scripts">Auto-copy Release Scripts</a>

            <strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;all&quot; argument specifies that all projects should be built.
            There has been some work done in order to select only specific projects (jsr308, AFU, Checker Framework)
            to be built but more work still needs to be done.  Just pass &quot;all&quot; for now.

                off and the script will run but not update anything.
            </div>

            If you get an obscure error about permissions, try running the release_push script several times
            in a row. This will sometimes update the repository permissions such that the script can proceed
            further each time.

    <h2>Release Process Overview</h2>
    <p>The release process consists of running two scripts, release_build.py and release_push.py,
        and a few manual steps (prompted by the release scripts).  However, before releasing, it would be beneficial
        to first understand the structure of the projects on disk on Buffalo.</p>

    <h2>Changelog Guidelines</h2>
    <p> Each developer is responsible for updating project changelogs to reflect changes they
        have made each month.  The changelogs should be updated by "feature freeze" though at the
        latest this should be done before "code freeze".  Before releasing, the person performing
        the release will be asked to verify the changelogs.  Please check that
        there aren't typos (i.e. missing release date/version information, spelling errors, etc...).
        Also check that the changelog obeys the guidelines below.
    </p>

    <section id="content_guidelines">
        <h3>Content Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Only (and all) changes that affect users go into the changelog.
                If a change is breaking, no matter how small, mention it.</li>
            <li>List all issues (in Google Code issue trackers) resolved in this release.  There is a step
                in the release that asks you to change all &quot;Pushed&quot; issues to &quot;Fixed&quot;; these
                issues should all be included in the changelog.  Search for the word &quot;issues&quot; in the
                changelog to see an example. Here is an example
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/checker-framework/issues/list?can=1&q=status%3Apushed&amp;sort=-closed&amp;colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary+Closed&amp;cells=tiles">query</a>
                to help find these issues for the Checker Framework only. It is a good idea to ask the core
                team of developers if they have any issues they have pushed but have not marked as pushed,
                and generally if they have any changes they would like to be listed in the changelog that
                they have not done so.
            </li>

            <li>You may need to be aware of projects for which we don't want an announcement.  For instance,
                the GuiEffectsChecker was added a few months before we finished writing a manual section for it.
                We did not announce it until this section was written.  If you have questions, ask the relevant
                developer whether or not something should be mentioned.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="style_guidelines">
        <h3>Style Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes are written from the user's perspective.  Don't include implementation details that users
                don't care about.
            </li>
            <li>To be consistent, write in the past tense (e.g. &quot;Added option for verbose error messages&quot;).</li>
            <li>Don't exceed the 80 character limit.</li>
            <li>Break the different programs into their own sections.  See notes on release 1.7.0 and 1.5.0 for an
                example.  Things like the Eclipse plugin and Maven plugin should have their own section within the
                Checker Framework release notes (excluding issue fixes from the issue tracker).
            </li>
            <li>Be specific.  Don't write something like "added a few options to Eclipse plugin".  Do write "added
                options to the Eclipse plugin to include stub files, ignore warnings, and show verbose output."

    <h2>Backing Out an Uncommitted Release</h2>
    <p>At the time of this writing, there are 2 steps that cannot be reverted.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The push from the interm repositories to the Google Code (release) repositories</li>
        <li>The release of the staged Maven artifacts</li>
    </ol>
    <p> If you have executed either of these steps and then realized there is a breaking error, you should do another
        release.  The release script will allow you to do a point release like &quot;1.8.0.1&quot; when a version
        &quot;1.8.0&quot; already exists.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you have NOT committed an irreversible step then you can
        follow the steps below to point the live release to a previous release.  You can then redo the original
        release.  Make sure to say &quot;yes&quot; when the release script asks you to delete the old directories.
    </p>
    <h3>Manual Steps to Back Out a Release</h3>
    <ul id="backing_out_steps">
        <li><strong>Point symlinks to old release</strong><br/>
            For each project (JSR308, Annotation File Utilities, Checker Framework), find the
            version for the previous release. <br/>
            In each project's top-level website directory: (e.g. /cse/www2/types/checker-framework )
            delete the symlink &quot;current&quot; (or use the force option of ln) and point it to the
            release directory of the previous release.  E.g.<br/>
            <code>ln -sf /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/releases/1.7.5 /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/current</code>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Drop the artifacts from Central</strong><br/>
            You may have staged and then closed the artifacts in the Sonatypes Central repository.  Drop (do NOT release)
            these artifacts.  See
            <a href="https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-DroppingaStagingRepository%28i.e.WhattoDoifYourStagingRepositoryHasErrors%29">
                the Sonatypes OSS Repository Usage Guidelines.
            </a>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Drop the Maven Artifacts from our Maven repo *** currently unneeded ***</strong>
            <p class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Note:</strong> The procedure below is NOT recommended
                by the Maven developers guide.  However, if done carefully and quickly no harm will likely
                come.  If people end up with out-of-date artifacts, recommend to them that they use the -U option
                in Maven 3.  Never follow these instructions if the plugin release has been publicized or
                existed for a while.
            </p>

            At the moment, we have decided to drop the user of our local Maven repository in favor of using
            the Central repository exclusively.  This may not be the case in the future.  If we do have a
            local repository, you need to go into the repositories directory (usually an m2-repo directory) and
            manually delete the versions of the Maven artifacts.  For instance, for the artifacts checker and compiler
            using version 0.9.8, I would delete the directories:
            <ul>
                <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/checker/0.9.8</li>
                <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/compiler/0.9.8</li>
            </ul>
            Furthermore, I would grep the files in the parents of these directories and ensure the version number
            does not appear in any metadata.  If so, fix up the metadata.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Note:</strong> You may find yourself copying release directories for some
        reason or other.  It is important to remember that the symlinks may be absolute.  You should check any
        symlinks that may be affected by the move and ensure they point to the new location and not the old one.

<section id="future_improvements">
    <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
    <p>Below is a roughly priority-ordered list of future improvements.  In a perfect world we would do
        all of these.  At the moment, I believe only the first 3 (Bug Fixes, Open JDK Javadoc Fixes,
        and More Sanity Checks) should have any appreciable priority.
    </p>

    <section id="fi_bug_fixes">
        <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
        A known bug at the moment is a failed 'hg strip' that happens once in a while when the script is
        cleaning the build/interm repositories.  Running the script a few times clears this.  It happens at the
        beginning of the script so this doesn't take long but it would be good to figure out why the command
        fails and fix it up.

        The cause seems to be the following:
        <ol>
            <li>A release_build is performed but not pushed to Google code.  Lets say the number for the parent
            commit of this release is 1 and the commit for the release itself is 2a.
            </li>
            <li>One or more pushes are made to the Google Code repositories.  That makes the Google code have
                a commit 2b which is a child of 1.
            </li>
            <li>When we try to strip the changeset 2a, for some reason it works but outputs NO text to
                standard out and has a return status of 0.  Perhaps we should just expect this behavior as
                one of the valid outputs of strip.  We check to make sure there are no outgoing or uncommitted
                changes before building anyways.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Open JDK/JSR308 Javadoc</h3>
        Generating the Javadocs for the entire JDK is not simple.  We have previously generated these but have
        not updated them in a while.  They can be found here:<br/>
        <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/jdk-api/">http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/jdk-api/</a><br/>
        When we generate javadoc for the Type Annotations Compiler and Checker Framework we link against these docs.
        But because they were generated in a faulty manner in the first place, there are many broken links related to
        package summaries of the jdk-api docs.  It is highly unlikely that users will ever run into these links, since
        they occur in pages like Swing's package summary, but nonetheless it would be good to build these docs
        in the proper manner with no broken links.

            <li>We may also want to put jdk-api into the release directory instead of overwriting it during each release.</li>

        <h3>More Sanity Checks</h3>
        There are likely more sanity checks we might want to run during the release process.  One such example

        the released artifacts rather than the staged artifacts.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>

        <h3>Buffalo Integration</h3>
        If we could have Buffalo run the release_build script nightly, we could head off broken links and other
        release related errors.  There is an &quot;--auto&quot; option for this specific reason but a number of
        errors start happening when we run the script from Buffalo.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a Buffalo task to run the release_buld script using the &quot;--auto&quot; option.</li>
            <li>Observe the output of this task and identify possible errors.</li>
            <li>Fix up all observed errors until the release_build script runs without error.</li>
            <li>We probably want to move the link checking of the development site to the release_build script and
                write it out to disk.  This will allow the developer releasing the framework to consult pre-made
                link-checking results rather than waiting for the link checker to execute in the push script.

        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Look up the latest Python parsing library.</li>

        <h3>Optional Projects</h3>
        A user might want to test the release_build script only on a specific project.  Some work has gone into
        the ability to select a project to build.  However, this currently doesn't take into consideration of dependencies.
        It might be more hassle than it's worth to implement this feature.  We should either complete the implementation
        or remove the partial implementation that already exists.  See <a href="#fi_repl_mode">REPL Mode</a>.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>

        <h3>REPL Mode</h3>
        The current script is built in an imperative style with little use of object orientation.  This improvement
        would create methods or objects that further encapsulate the current set of steps.  We could then provide
        an easy way to execute these steps from the Python REPL.  This would allow the user to execute individual steps
        in whatever order they saw fit from the Python REPL.  This could also be used to
        automatically back out the current release or the ability to edit/debug the release steps more easily.
        <h4>Tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Further separate the steps of the release process.</li>
            <li>Provide a default parameterization for these steps to make them easily runnable from the
