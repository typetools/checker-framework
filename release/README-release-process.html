  This document explains how to make a release of the Checker Framework, the Type Annotations Compiler,
  and the Annotation File Utilities.
The process takes around 3 hours (including manual steps) when all goes according to plan.
  However, the lengthiest steps are automatic so you will be able to work on other tasks.

<h3 id="checklist">Checklist of steps a release person must follow</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Once ever:
        <ul>
          <li>Follow the steps in the <a href="#pre_release_checklist">Pre-release Checklist</a>
           in the Release Process document. Some of these steps can take days to complete as they
            involve obtaining permissions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
       <li>First day of the development milestone:
         <ul>
           <li>Plan the feature freeze, code freeze and release dates for the following two months.  The release date should be the first business day of the month.  (Avoid releasing
             near the end of a month instead of the beginning of the next month, as that makes it easier for users
             to keep track of the cadence of our releases.  For example, having a June 1st and a June 30th release makes
             it harder to tell that the June 30th release is meant for distribution in the month of July.)
           </li>
           <li>
           Send an e-mail to the
             checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev mailing lists with these dates.
           <!--
             Also please make sure to add these dates to the "Checker Framework Developers" Google Calendar.
           -->
             </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>One week before Feature Freeze:
         <ul>
          <li>Remind bug owners of their bugs outstanding.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>Two business days before Feature Freeze:
         <ul>
          <li>E-mail checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev reminding
          users of the upcoming Feature Freeze and the requirements for this deadline, including
          the requirement for changelogs to be complete.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>The work morning after Feature Freeze:
         <ul>
           <li>Ensure that all the <a href="#continuous-integration">continuous integration jobs</a> are passing.</li>
           <li>Ensure that
           the changelogs and documentation for the Checker Framework, Type Annotations Compiler and AFU are complete by following
           <a href="#step_by_step">these instructions</a> up to and including the &quot;Review the changelogs and documentation&quot; step.
           <li>E-mail Mike asking him to vet the changelogs
           that are checked in.</li>
           <li>E-mail checker-framework-dev, annotation-tools-dev and jsr308-langtools-dev reminding
           users of the upcoming Code Freeze and the requirements for this deadline.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>The work morning after Code Freeze:
         <ul>
           <li>Ensure that all the <a
           href="#continuous-integration">continuous
           integration jobs</a> are passing.</li>
           <li>If the above items are taken care of, perform the release.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>

    </ol>

<!--
    <h3 id="notes-for-release-person">Recommendations/notes for the release person</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>As the release person, consider pushing your bug fixes at least two days prior to the code freeze deadline &mdash; this is because you
      are likely to be helping other people make their Jenkins projects become green during those two days.</li>
      <li>The reason Mike must be asked to look at the changelogs right after feature freeze (instead of
      code freeze) is that there no longer is a "recall class" bug fix period, so there is now only one
      working day between feature freeze and the release.
      This ensures that there are no delays in releasing the products (due to
      incomplete changelogs) or in sending the announcement e-mail.
      If during the bug fixing period anyone fixes a bug that is worth mentioning as more
      than a number, the changelog can be amended accordingly and Mike can be warned about it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="phases-description">Description of the phases and deadlines</h3>
    <p style="background-color: #6d9de9">Development</p>
    <p>During the development phase, arbitrarily large or complex changes may be pushed.</p>
    <p style="background-color:blue">Feature freeze</p>
    <p>By the <em>feature freeze </em>deadline, all new feature code, associated tests, and documentation
    must be pushed. If a feature is not complete by this time, then it should be delayed until the next
    release. By this time, all users should update the relevant project&rsquo;s changelog to include
    features and bug fixes they have made during this development cycle (not including bug fixes made
    in the day that follows).</p>
    <p style="background-color: #92c27d">Bug fixing</p>
    <p>During this phase bugs are fixed, including minor bugs that may have been discovered
    (by the new tests or otherwise) in the feature implementation or documentation. You are allowed
    to fix any bug that you want, add new tests and documentation, etc., during this time. But no
    new features may be implemented. Example bugs that would be fixed during this phase are bugs
    revealed by Jenkins that were not revealed by the test suites that were run before pushing a feature.</p>
    <p style="color:#6aa74f">Code freeze</p>
    <p>By <em>code freeze</em>, the code is assumed to be in a shippable state. Pushes to the
    repository are no longer allowed.</p>
    <p style="background-color: #d0e0e3">Release</p>
    <p>The person responsible for making the release runs the release scripts and other manual tasks
    for the release (note that any pushes during this phase force the automated tests to restart and
    are likely to delay the release).</p>
    <h3 id="deadline-enforcement">Deadline enforcement</h3>
    <p>The following are only enforced for the 'master' branch from which the release is performed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any large or complex change (i.e. a feature change or a design change) pushed after
      feature freeze will be reverted.</li>
      <li>Any fix for a bug pushed after code freeze for which an exception was not made will be reverted.</li>
      <li>If a critical bug is discovered late and its fix is not checked in with enough time
      for Jenkins tests to complete before Release Day, <strong>then the release is delayed</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="step_by_step">Step by Step</h2>

<p>
  More information about the steps is
  provided in the code comments of the <code>main()</code> functions of the <code>release_build</code>
  and <code>release_push</code> scripts. Please read those comments if you have never done so before.
</p>

<p>
Answering 'no' to a prompt does not exit the script unless otherwise indicated.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to carefully read all instructions on the command-line before answering 'yes' to a prompt.
This is because the scripts do not ask you to say 'yes' after each step, so you may
miss a step if you only read the paragraph asking you to say 'yes'.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you have never made a release before, follow the instructions in the
  <a href="#pre_release_checklist">Pre-release Checklist</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Download and install the lastest version of Eclipse.  Check that the Eclipse version
      matches the version listed in
      <a href="../eclipse/checker-framework-eclipse-update-site/manual/index.html#installation">the Eclipse plugin manual</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Log into Buffalo</strong><br/>
      <code>ssh $USER@buffalo.cs.washington.edu<br/></code>
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>In a user-specific temporary directory, clone/update the Checker Framework repository (it contains the release scripts).</strong><br/>
      <code>mkdir -p /scratch/$USER/jsr308-release<br/></code>
      <code>cd /scratch/$USER/jsr308-release<br/></code>
      <code>(cd checker-framework && git pull --quiet) || git clone --quiet https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework.git<br/></code>
      <code>cd checker-framework/release<br/></code>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Review the changelogs and documentation</strong><br/>
      Ensure that the changelogs and documentation for the Checker Framework, Type Annotations Compiler and
      AFU are complete.  First follow the instructions at <a href="#content_guidelines">content guidelines</a>.  Then,
      run release_build in a mode that reviews the documentation only:
      <code>cd /scratch/$USER/jsr308-release/checker-framework/release<br/></code>
      <code>python release_build.py all --review-manual</code><br/><br/>
      <strong>Note:</strong> This step can be performed in advance of the release day. It is recommended
      that this be done the work morning after Feature Freeze.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Run release_build</strong> to create the release artifacts and place them in the development website<br/>
      <code>python release_build.py all --auto</code><br/><br/>
      For verbose debugging output, use the <code>--debug</code> option.<br/><br/>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;all&quot; argument specifies that all projects should be built.
      There has been some work done in order to select only specific projects (JSR 308 compiler, AFU, Checker Framework)
      to be built but more work still needs to be done.  Just pass &quot;all&quot; for now.
      See also <a href="#fi_buffalo_integeration">Buffalo Integration</a> for more information
      on the option &quot;--auto&quot;, which you can omit in order to
      be asked more questions during the build.
  </li>
  <li>
      <strong>Run release_push</strong> to move release artifacts from the development website to the live site and to Maven Central <br/>
      <code>python release_push.py release</code><br/><br/>
      For minimal prompting, use the <code>--auto</code> option.<br/><br/>
      <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The &quot;<strong>release</strong>&quot; argument states that you intend
        to do an actual release.  If you just want to test the script, leave out &quot;release&quot;
        and the script will run but not update anything.
      </div>

      If you get an obscure error about permissions, try running the release_push script several times
      in a row. This will sometimes update the repository permissions such that the script can proceed
      further each time.
  </li>
</ol>

  <h2 id="continuous-integration">Continuous integration (nightly) tests</h2>

  <p>
    The following continuous integration tests should all pass before you make changes that you need to test.  If not, notify the
    relevant team members.
  </p>

    <h3 id="release_scripts">Release Scripts</h3>
    <p>As mentioned above, in order to release the Checker Framework you must run two scripts,
      release_build.py and release_push.py but there are supportings scripts and files in the
      release directory.  Some of these files are described below.

          It also pushes Maven artifacts to our checker-framework.com repo and Maven central.

  <h2 id="changelog_guide">Changelog Guidelines</h2>
  <p> Each developer is responsible for updating project changelogs to reflect changes they
    have made each month.  The changelogs should be updated by "feature freeze" though at the
    latest this should be done before "code freeze".  Before releasing, the person performing
    the release will be asked to verify the changelogs.  Please check that
    there aren't typos (i.e. missing release date/version information, spelling errors, etc...).
    Also check that the changelog obeys the guidelines below.
  </p>

    <h3 id="content_guidelines">Content Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only (and all) changes that affect users go into the changelog.
        If a change is breaking, no matter how small, mention it.</li>
      <li>List all issues (in issue trackers) resolved since the previous release, for
          the Checker Framework (<a href="https://checkerframework.org/changelog.txt">previous release</a>,

      </li>
          <li>
            Examine the version control logs since the last release tag to ensure they are reflected in the changelogs when appropriate.
        This can be done from the command-line with:<br/>
            <code>cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && git log --name-status `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`..</code><br/>
            <code>cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/../annotation-tools && git log --name-status `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`..</code><br/>
            <code>cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/../jsr308-langtools && hg log -r `hg log -r "." --template "{latesttag}\n"`:</code><br/>
        or by opening the following commit queries for <a href="https://bitbucket.org/typetools/jsr308-langtools/commits/all">jsr308-langtools</a>,
        the <a href="https://github.com/typetools/annotation-tools/commits/master">Annotation File Utilities</a> and the
            <a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/commits/master">Checker Framework</a>.
      </li>
          <li>
            Even if some code has been committed to the repository, don't
            announce the feature until it has been documented in the manual.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="style_guidelines">Style Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Changes are written from the user's perspective.  Don't include implementation details that users
        don't care about.
      </li>
      <li>To be consistent, write in the past tense (e.g. &quot;Added option for verbose error messages&quot;).</li>
      <li>Lines should not exceed 80 characters wide.</li>
      <li>Break the different programs into their own sections.  See notes on release 1.7.0 and 1.5.0 for an
        example.  Tools like the Eclipse plugin should have their own section within the
        Checker Framework release notes (excluding issue fixes from the issue tracker).
      </li>
      <li>Be specific.  Don't write something like "added a few options to Eclipse plugin".  Do write "added
        options to the Eclipse plugin to include stub files, ignore warnings, and show verbose output."
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="backing_out">Backing Out an Uncommitted Release</h2>
  <p>At the time of this writing, there are 2 steps that cannot be reverted.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The push from the interm repositories to the GitHub/Bitbucket (release) repositories</li>
    <li>The release of the staged Maven artifacts</li>
  </ol>
  <p> If you have executed either of these steps and then realized there is a breaking error, you should do another
    release.  The release script will allow you to do a point release like &quot;1.8.0.1&quot; when a version
    &quot;1.8.0&quot; already exists.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you have NOT committed an irreversible step then you can
    follow the steps below to point the live release to a previous release.  You can then redo the original
    release.  Make sure to say &quot;yes&quot; when the release script asks you to delete the old directories.
  </p>
  <h3 id="backing_out_steps">Manual Steps to Back Out a Release</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Drop the artifacts from Central</strong><br/>
      You may have staged and then closed the artifacts in the Sonatypes Central repository.  Drop (do NOT release)
      these artifacts.  See
      <a href="https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide#SonatypeOSSMavenRepositoryUsageGuide-DroppingaStagingRepository%28i.e.WhattoDoifYourStagingRepositoryHasErrors%29">
        the Sonatypes OSS Repository Usage Guidelines.
      </a>
    </li>
    <!-- <li><strong>Drop the Maven Artifacts from our Maven repo *** currently unneeded ***</strong>
      <p class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Note:</strong> The procedure below is NOT recommended
        by the Maven developers guide.  However, if done carefully and quickly no harm will likely
        come.  If people end up with out-of-date artifacts, recommend to them that they use the -U option
        in Maven 3.  Never follow these instructions if the plugin release has been publicized or
        existed for a while.
      </p>

      At the moment, we have decided to drop the user of our local Maven repository in favor of using
      the Central repository exclusively.  This may not be the case in the future.  If we do have a
      local repository, you need to go into the repositories directory (usually an m2-repo directory) and
      manually delete the versions of the Maven artifacts.  For instance, for the artifacts checker and compiler
      using version 0.9.8, I would delete the directories:
      <ul>
        <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/checker/0.9.8</li>
        <li>.../m2-repo/org/checkerframework/compiler/0.9.8</li>
      </ul>
      Furthermore, I would grep the files in the parents of these directories and ensure the version number
      does not appear in any metadata.  If so, fix up the metadata.
    </li> -->
  </ul>

  <p class="alert alert-danger"><strong>Note:</strong> You may find yourself copying release directories for some
    reason or other.  It is important to remember that the symlinks may be absolute.  You should check any
    symlinks that may be affected by the move and ensure they point to the new location and not the old one.
  </p>

  <h2 id="future_improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
  <p>Below is a roughly priority-ordered list of future improvements.  In a perfect world we would do
    all of these.  At the moment, I believe only the first 2 (Open JDK Javadoc Fixes,
    and More Sanity Checks) should have any appreciable priority.
  </p>

    <h3 id="fi_jdk-api_fixup">Open JDK/JSR308 Javadoc</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    Generating the Javadocs for the entire JDK is not simple.  We have previously generated these but have
    not updated them in a while.  They can be found here:<br/>
    <a href="https://checkerframework.org/jdk-api/">https://checkerframework.org/jdk-api/</a><br/>
    When we generate javadoc for the Type Annotations Compiler and Checker Framework we link against these docs.
    But because they were generated in a faulty manner in the first place, there are many broken links related to
    package summaries of the jdk-api docs.  It is highly unlikely that users will ever run into these links, since
    they occur in pages like Swing's package summary, but nonetheless it would be good to build these docs
    in the proper manner with no broken links.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Figure out the best way to build the Open JDK Javadoc.</li>
      <li>Add a release script step to build the Open JDK Javadoc.</li>
      <li>Add a release script step to copy this javadoc to /cse/www2/types/checker-framework/jdk-api.</li>
      <li>We may also want to put jdk-api into the release directory instead of overwriting it during each release.</li>
      <li>Update this document to reflect the new steps.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="fi_more_sanity_checks">More Sanity Checks</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    There are likely more sanity checks we might want to run during the release process.  One such example
    would be running the tutorial from the command line.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Implement one of the sanity checks mentioned in this section.</li>
      <li>Add your sanity check to the appropriate location in the release_push script.</li>
      <li>Update this document to reflect the new steps.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="sanity-checks">Sanity Checks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Run tutorial sanity check automatically via command line.</li>
      <li>Eclipse auto-sanity check see <a href="#fi_automate_eclipse_build">Automate the Eclipse Build.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="fi_buffalo_integeration">Buffalo Integration</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    If we could have Buffalo run the release_build script nightly, we could head off broken links and other
    release related errors.  There is an &quot;--auto&quot; option for this specific reason but a number of
    errors start happening when we run the script from Buffalo.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Create a Buffalo task to run the release_buld script using the &quot;--auto&quot; option.</li>
      <li>Observe the output of this task and identify possible errors.</li>
      <li>Fix up all observed errors until the release_build script runs without error.</li>
      <li>We probably want to move the link checking of the development site to the release_build script and
        write it out to disk.  This will allow the developer releasing the framework to consult pre-made
        link-checking results rather than waiting for the link checker to execute in the push script.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="fi_auto-copy_release_scripts">Auto-copy Release Scripts</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    The first step in running the release process, after the pre-release checklist, is to copy the
    release scripts into the jsr308-release directory.  We could automate this.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Create a read-only script in jsr308-release/scripts.</li>
      <li>Edit the script so that it downloads all release scripts into the jsr308-release directory.</li>
      <li>Update this document to reflect this new process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="fi_option_parsing">Option Parsing</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    There is currently some primitive option parsing written into the release scripts.  We should use
    Python's built-in option parsing library.  There are multiple built-in libraries.  Please use the latest one.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Look up the latest Python parsing library.</li>
      <li>Replace the option parsing in the release_build.py and release_push.py scripts with library calls.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="fi_option_projects">Optional Projects</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    A user might want to test the release_build script only on a specific project.  Some work has gone into
    the ability to select a project to build.  However, this currently doesn't take into consideration of dependencies.
    It might be more hassle than it's worth to implement this feature.  We should either complete the implementation
    or remove the partial implementation that already exists.  See <a href="#fi_repl_mode">REPL Mode</a>.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Improve option parsing to allow the user to select only certain projects to build.</li>
      <li>Improve scripts to resolve dependencies between projects and only build the selected projects and
        their dependencies.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="fi_repl_mode">REPL Mode</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    The current script is built in an imperative style with little use of object orientation.  This improvement
    would create methods or objects that further encapsulate the current set of steps.  We could then provide
    an easy way to execute these steps from the Python REPL.  This would allow the user to execute individual steps
    in whatever order they saw fit from the Python REPL.  This could also be used to
    automatically back out the current release or the ability to edit/debug the release steps more easily.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Further separate the steps of the release process.</li>
      <li>Provide a default parameterization for these steps to make them easily runnable from the
        command line. </li>
      <li>Provide a script to launch Python with these commands on its path.</li>
      <li>Update this README to document the new functionality.</li>
    </ul>
  <section id="fi_automate_eclipse_build"> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <h3>Automate the Eclipse Build</h3> <!-- omit from toc -->
    The Checker Framework Eclipse plugin is the cause of the most burdensome manual steps in the release
    process.  There exist ways to automate the plugin build and tests.  However, the process is complicated and
    would take a while to perfect.  It may or may not be worth it.
    <h4>Tasks:</h4> <!-- omit from toc -->
    <ul>
      <li>Use Ant or other methods to automate the Eclipse build.</li>
      <li>Add to the release script targets for updating version numbers and other relevant fields
        of the Eclipse plugin for the release.
      </li>
      <li>Add a step(s) to build/test the Eclipse plugin from the command line to the release script.</li>
      <li>Update this README to include the new steps.</li>
