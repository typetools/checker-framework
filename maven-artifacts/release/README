This entire folder has been created solely to deploy artifacts to Maven
central.  The POMs found in the maven-artifacts/poms directory can be used
to install a file to our local repositories.  The POMS found in this
directory are used to provide information to the Central Repository when
deploying there.

File `README-jdk` contains information for the `jdk8-source.jar` and
`jdk8-javadoc.jar` artifacts and is used in `docs/developer/release/release.xml`
